The insurance hypothesis (Yachi &amp; Loreau 1999) states that ...must set up the diversity - stability thing here......led to the description of the portfolio effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>The portfolio effect, essentially statistical averaging, is one explanation for stability in multi-species communities.&nbsp; This effect occurs when species have asynchronous responses to environmental perturbations, but when summed across the community the responses average out statistically leading to increased stability with increased diversity (Cotthingham et al 2001, Doak et al 1998).&nbsp; This effect can be conveyed through the mechanisms of species' intrinsic responses, the speed of those responses, and a reduction in interspecific competition (Yachi &amp; Loreau 1999, Loreau &amp; de Mazancourt 2013).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>While numerous theories have been advanced to explain patterns of community composition, no single unifying construct seems adequate to explain observed patterns of species co-existence (Wilson 2011). Much of the previous work on mechanisms governing community composition occurred in terrestrial systems where factors governing species co-existence could be carefully controlled, monitored, and compared. In marine systems identifying opportunities for comparative studies is more difficult&nbsp; and thus there are fewer studies comparing patterns and mechanisms of differences in community composition in the oceans (Smith et al. 1993).&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Recent studies have suggested that response redundancy can lead to improved stability of ecosystem functions within marine ecosystems ?????through alternative pathways for stability (Schindler et al. 2015; Schindler et al. 2010)?????.<br></div><div><br></div><div>The mechanisms underlying the portfolio effect intersect with community composition effects through redundancy, structure,????? and the interaction terms?????.&nbsp; If these concepts do have a stabilizing effect, we hypothesize that portfolios would be preserved across space (ecoregions) within large marine ecosystems that have similar large scale environmental forcing.&nbsp; We further hypothesize that if portfolios are preserved across space within large marine ecosystems (LMEs) with similar environmental exposure, then similar suites of species would be found within ecoregions.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Boreal marine systems such as the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) experience high levels of seasonal, interannual, decadal and multi-decadal variability which in turn impact marine species (Anderson and Piatt 1999; Hare and Mantua 2000; Hollowed et al. 2001; Stachura et al. 2014).&nbsp; These climate driven perturbations create states of non-equilibrium at multiple spatial scales.&nbsp; The GOA provides an excellent region to examine mechanisms governing community composition and the portfolio effect.&nbsp; The region exhibits complex topography being punctuated by submarine troughs and canyons which act to steer currents (Lagerloef 1983).&nbsp; Previous studies have utilized this complex topography for natural experiments based on the comparison of responses of selected fish species to natural or anthropogenic disturbance (Hollowed et al. 2007; Logerwell et al. 2007; Walline et al. 2012). <br></div><div><br></div><div>We focused our study on examining the portfolio effect on ecosystem responses to natural (e.g., regime shifts (Anderson and Piatt 1999)) and anthropogenic (e.g., the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (EVOS) (Incardona et al. 2015)) environmental perturbations.&nbsp; We tested species responses through time and functional complementarity, two mechanisms of the portfolio effect (Loreau &amp; de Mazancourt 2013).&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>We also reviewed three of the most promising of the 12 hypotheses governing species co-existence which were reviewed by Wilson (2011):<br></div><div><br></div><div>1. Alpha-niche differentiation – stabilizing<br></div><div>2. Environmental fluctuation – stabilizing [ via relative non-linearity and/or the storage effect see (Chesson 2004)]<br></div><div>3. Allogenic disturbance – stabilizing [intermediate disturbance; although climate variability occurs on large spatial scales, fishing occurs at intermediate scales, therefore this hypothesis is retained here]<br></div><div><br></div><div>We then extended single species studies to explore the evidence for community stability and commonality in regional species portfolios as measured by common members of species complexes, and stability in species diversity.  It is unclear which of the potential ecosystem disturbances: environmental variability, fishing, and predation (Gaichas et al. 2011).  We expect that explorations of these relationships on a regional basis will elucidate key processes underlying GOA ecosystems.  <br></div>
