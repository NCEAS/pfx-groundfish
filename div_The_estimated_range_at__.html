<div>The estimated range at which the
spatial correlation in the spatial field falls to 0.05 after accounting for
depth ranged from 10km â€“ 500km with most species exhibiting a range of 65km.
Species with higher frequencies of occurrence tended to have lower spatial
ranges with the dominant species (cod, halibut, sablefish, and pollock) being
less than 60km. Area expansions derived from the model were used to estimate
abundance for each of the 9 sub-regions. Some information is shared between
regions due to the the spatial range of correlations, however in most
species/region cases the distances between the 9 regions exceeded the species
range. For each of the nine regions the mean and variance of biomass by species
was calculated. It should be noted that the species exhibit different
vulnerability to the survey trawl. Thus, all results reflect the demersal shelf
fish community.<br></div>
