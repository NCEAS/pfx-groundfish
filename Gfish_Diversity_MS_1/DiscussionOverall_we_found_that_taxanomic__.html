<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion<br></h1><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>Overall, we found that taxanomic and functional diversity varied little at either local or regional spatial scales across the GOA large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; Species richness showed some variation longitudinally, while alpha diversity (exp<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="H" contenteditable="false">\(H\)</span>) was consistently low, and beta diversity (<span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span>) and&nbsp;functional diversity (Rao's Q) were consistently high across the 10 study areas.&nbsp; Community composition also varied longitudinally, driven by turnover of lower-biomass species.&nbsp; However, disturbance (fishing pressure) varied unimodally only with local diversity (species richness and exp<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="H" contenteditable="false">\(H\)</span>).&nbsp; Thus, despite differences in species traits, disturbance, community composition, and environmental variation,  diversity and community 
structure were stable across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; This spatial stability  appears to have been
largely driven by environmental heterogeneity (species sorting), 
functional redundancy, and disturbance (fishing pressure).&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Diversity</b><br></div><div>Despite variation in species richness
and community composition across local communities, our metrics of diversity and community composition indicate that community structure is conserved across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; We found statistically invariant (<i>do we know this?)</i> alpha diversity,<b> i.e. local communities
had a similar degree of skew in relative abundance among those species present
in the community.</b>&nbsp; This result is corroborated by our metric of community
structure <i>(either Ole’s triangle figure
(so far only for shallow areas) or we could plot ratios of predator:prey
abundance for each local community),</i> which indicated that local communities
are consistently dominated by apex predators<b>****</b>, with similar ratios of predator :
prey abundance.<br></div><div>Functional diversity, computed from traits
representing multiple uncorrelated elements of community
structure, was invariant, suggesting that
local communities were structured similarly with respect to functional
roles and contained species that were functionally redundant.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>Diversity is relatively constant across an expansive space.&nbsp; Each ecoregion supports a similar
level of species richness - but note difference between expected richness and raw species richness.&nbsp; <br></div><div>e.g. Ole's feeding 
guilds result - how does this link to (i) our functional diversity 
result, and (ii) the dominant vs subdominant result (dominant apex preds
 do not show spatial variability, subdominant prey do)<br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity were low relative to regional (gamma) 
diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low saturation
 relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp; y). [MH: We might 
add the caveat of gamma diversity - we/Ole selected the total # of 
species]. This could shed
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms.<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Intriguingly, we  found that spatial turnover in community composition occured among
subdominant (Fig. Z c, d) but not dominant (Fig. Z a, b) species. The degree of turnover varied somewhat between our study areas, and was strongest in areas 1 - 7 and weaker towards sites 8 - 10 as evidenced by reduced distances between centroids following the
Hellinger transformation (see Supp Figs). In other words, identity and community composition of
numerically dominant species (Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific
halibut, Walleye pollock, Pacific cod) was invariant among eastern sites, and less
variable than subdominant species among westernmost sites.&nbsp; Instead, changes in community composition
occurred among subdominant species along the longitudinal
(environmental) gradient.&nbsp; This result,
combined with invariance in functional diversity and predator-prey ratios,
suggests that there was functional
redundancy among sub-dominant species as they were sequentially
replaced along the longitudinal (environmental) gradient, i.e. subdominant
species were replaced along the longitudinal gradient in such a way that they
filled the same community roles in each local community. <br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Consider
citing evidence from the literature for conserved community structure (with or
without conserved species identity) across environmental gradients: e.g.
Sprules’ (2008) conserved biomass size spectra (conserved zooplankton community
structure over time in Lakes Erie and Ontario, and conserved whole-food-web
structure across an environmental gradient between 4 lakes). Other studies?</i><br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The high beta diversity and spatial
turnover in community composition we observed may help buffer the regional Gulf
of Alaska groundfish community against perturbations. We documented evidence
for a spatial portfolio effect: greater
temporal instability in local vs regional communities was associated with lower
diversity (exp H’) in local vs regional communities (<i>I think we can say 'associated with' because we see this pattern in
both our shallow &amp; deep areas, kind of like having 2 replicates</i>).&nbsp; A primary mechanism underlying the
spatial portfolio effect is species’ differential responses to environmental
conditions and perturbations (Wang &amp; Loreau 2014, definitely cite other lit
too). In the GoA groundfish community, the importance of environmental
heterogeneity (species sorting) and functional complementarity mechanisms
underlying spatial patterns of diversity may contribute to
the spatial portfolio effect ...<br></div><div><br></div><div>How the various components of diversity (alpha, beta (re

empirical spatial diversity-stability papers published to date). 
Probably 2-3 paragraphs on this.<br></div><br><div><br></div><div>Within local 
communities, instability (high CV) can arise from low diversity, large 
between-year fluctuations (high StDev) in abundance, or from low mean 
abundance. Greater temporal instability 
in local vs regional communities was associated with lower diversity in 
local vs regional communities StDev of total community abundance for 
each local area: range 16-45 (2.8-fold variation). Means of total 
community abundance: range 88 - 232 (2.6-fold

 In shallow areas 1-7 east of Kodiak , compositional turnover was driven by rare and 
intermediate-density species; community composition with respect to the 
most abundant species did not show spatial 
turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were 
transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; 
d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to 
allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure
 (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b). In 
other words, all the spatial turnover is going on at the level of less 
abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species 
(here, top predators) show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><div><div><br></div><div>Portfolio effect as a buffer against ecosystem
