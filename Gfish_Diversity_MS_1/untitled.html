 Much of the previous work on mechanisms governing community composition
 occurred in terrestrial systems where factors governing species 
co-existence could be carefully controlled, monitored, and compared. In 
marine systems, identifying opportunities for comparative studies is 
more difficult and thus there are fewer studies comparing patterns and 
mechanisms of differences in community composition in the oceans (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

Species-rich communities are thought to produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because of the complementary or independent dynamics among species that perform similar ecosystem functions. Such variance dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio effect and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity on the stability of financial portfolios. In ecology, these arguments have focused on the effects of species diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered the importance of biologically relevant diversity within individual species. Current rates of population extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude higher than species extinction rates, so there is a pressing need to clarify how population and life history diversity affect the performance of individual species in providing important ecosystem services. Here we use five decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of portfolio effects that derive from population and life history diversity in an important and heavily exploited species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted of a single homogenous population rather than the several hundred discrete populations it currently consists of. Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population, such increased variability would lead to ten times more frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results demonstrate the critical importance of maintaining population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them.

	abstract = {Acoustic trawl surveys were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in two troughs located off the eastern coast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska as part of a multiyear, multidisciplinary experiment to examine the influence of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of adult and juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). Continuous underway sea surface temperature samples and water column profiles collected in 2000 and 2001 showed the presence of a sharp shelf-break front in Chiniak Trough and a mid-trough front in Barnabas Trough. At distances {\textless}22&nbsp;km from shore, the water column was well mixed, whereas a well-defined mixed layer was present beyond approximately 22&nbsp;km from shore. Satellite drifter tracks in Barnabas Trough entered along the upstream edge of the trough and appeared to follow the frontal boundary across the middle portion of the trough. A storm in 2001 weakened stratification and cooled surface water temperature by 1.6–2.1°C. Wind mixing associated with the storm event mixed subsurface chlorophyll a to the surface and enhanced nutrients in the surface waters. The storm event revealed spatial partitioning of summer production in Barnabas Trough, with production concentrated in regions inside the mid-trough front. In contrast, post-storm summer production was distributed throughout Chiniak Trough. The spatial distribution of walleye pollock and capelin differed and appeared to be related to differences in habitat characteristics. Acoustic survey data identified four acoustic sign types: age-1 pollock, adult pollock, capelin, capelin–age-0 pollock mix. The spatial distribution of these four sign types appears to be influenced by the oceanographic and topographic features of the two troughs. Adult pollock were broadly distributed throughout Chiniak Trough, whereas adult pollock were aggregated on the coastal side of the frontal system in Barnabas Trough. In 2000, capelin occurred with age-0 pollock. In Chiniak Trough, capelin were most abundant along steep topographic gradients at the edges of the trough and in a deep region near Cape Chiniak, whereas the capelin–age-0 mix (2000) or capelin (2001) concentrations were observed in slope water intrusions over the outer shelf in Barnabas Trough. Results suggest that habitat selection of walleye pollock and capelin are controlled by different processes. Capelin distributions appear to be limited by oceanographic conditions while other factors appear to be more important for pollock.},

	abstract = {Results from this study suggest that small-scale variability in the Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) and competition between juvenile pollock and capelin are potential mechanisms affecting the distribution and abundance of fishes in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA). Fish distributions in Barnabus Trough, off the east coast of Kodiak Island, were assessed using acoustic data collected with a calibrated echosounder during August–September 2002 and 2004. Trawl hauls were conducted to determine the species composition of the fish making up the acoustic backscatter. Oceanographic data were collected from moorings, conductivity–temperature–depth (CTD) probes, trawl-mounted microbathythermographs (MBT) and expendable bathythermographs (XBT). National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data were used to assess area winds, and information on regional transport was derived from current meters deployed on moorings north and south of Kodiak Island. The distribution of water-mass properties and fish during 2002 showed variability at the temporal scale of weeks. Juvenile pollock (age-1 and age-2) were initially most abundant in warm, low-salinity water on the inner shelf, whereas capelin were distributed primarily on the outer shelf in cool, high-salinity waters. During a 2-week period juvenile pollock distribution expanded with the offshore expansion of warm, low-salinity water, and capelin abundance in outer-shelf waters decreased. We hypothesize that wind-driven pulsing of the ACC resulted in increased transport of warm, low-salinity water through the study area. In 2004, warm, low-salinity water characterized the inner shelf and cool, high-salinity water was found on the outer shelf. However, the distribution of water-mass properties did not show the weekly scale variability observed in 2002. Area winds were consistently toward the southwest during 2004, such that we would not expect to see the wind-driven pulsing of ACC water that occurred in 2002. Age-1 and age-2 pollock were not observed in Barnabus Trough in 2004. Instead, the midwater acoustic backscatter was composed of capelin mixed with age-0 pollock, and these capelin were not restricted to the outer-shelf waters, but were found primarily in warm, low-salinity inner-shelf waters that had been previously occupied exclusively by age-1 and age-2 pollock. We suggest that this is consistent with inner-shelf waters being preferred foraging habitat for juvenile pollock and capelin. Further study of the mechanisms linking climate change with variability in the ACC is needed, as are studies of the potential for competition between juvenile pollock and capelin.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976–77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10–15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965–1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone.},

	abstract = {It is now widely accepted that a climatic regime shift transpired in the North Pacific Ocean in the winter of 1976–77. This regime shift has had far reaching consequences for the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific. Despite the strength and scope of the changes initiated by the shift, it was 10–15 years before it was fully recognized. Subsequent research has suggested that this event was not unique in the historical record but merely the latest in a succession of climatic regime shifts. In this study, we assembled 100 environmental time series, 31 climatic and 69 biological, to determine if there is evidence for common regime signals in the 1965–1997 period of record. Our analysis reproduces previously documented features of the 1977 regime shift, and identifies a further shift in 1989 in some components of the North Pacific ecosystem. The 1989 changes were neither as pervasive as the 1977 changes nor did they signal a simple return to pre-1977 conditions. A notable feature of the 1989 regime shift is the relative clarity that is found in biological records, which contrasts with the relative lack of clear changes expressed by indices of Pacific climate. Thus, the large marine ecosystems of the North Pacific and Bering Sea appear to filter climate variability strongly, and respond nonlinearly to environmental forcing. We conclude that monitoring North Pacific and Bering Sea ecosystems may allow for an earlier identification of regime shifts than is possible from monitoring climate data alone.},

The timing of ENSO events and of related oceanic changes at higher latitudes were examined. The frequency of ENSO was high in the 1980s. Evidence of ENSO forcing on ocean conditions in the North Pacific (Niño North conditions) showed ENSO events were more frequently observed along the West Coast than in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Time series of catches for 30 region/species groups of salmon, and recruitment data for 29 groundfish and 5 non-salmonid pelagic species, were examined for evidence of a statistical relationship with any of the time scales associated with Niño North conditions or the PDO. Some flatfish stocks exhibited high autocorrelation in recruitment coupled with a significant step in recruitment in 1977 suggesting a relationship between PDO forcing and recruitment success. Five of the dominant gadid stocks (EBS and GOA Pacific cod, Pacific hake and EBS and GOA walleye pollock) exhibited low autocorrelation in recruitment.

 but the responses of diverse marine communities are not well 
understood.&nbsp; These climate-driven perturbations can have impacts at 
multiple spatial 
scales as can other disturbances such as oil spills.&nbsp; 
One of the largest marine oil spills on record, the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS) impacted
 shoreline and shelf areas in a large portion of the GOA region, and 
threatened rich fisheries and cultural resources.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>Need to elaborate on the climate, oceanographic, and oil spill impacts in the context of large-scale perturbations to the system that happened during the period of our study.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><b><i>(The purpose of this paragraph is to introduce the GoA and 
groundfish in the context of (ie making links to) spatial processes 
mentioned in the paragraph above)</i></b> The GoA provides an opportune region in which
 to examine mechanisms governing community composition and a spatial 
portfolio effect. Boreal marine systems such as the GoA experience 
high levels of seasonal, interannual, decadal and multi-decadal 
variability which in turn impact marine species (Anderson &amp; Piatt 
1999, Hare &amp; Mantua 2000, Hollowed et al. 2001, Stachura et al. 
2014). These climate-driven perturbations create states of 
non-equilibrium at multiple spatial scales. (<i>Briefly elaborate on this ... </i>) We 
expect some of these perturbations to be homogenizing at a 
cross-ecosystem scale (e.g. the strong Alaska Coastal Current (<i>link to dispersal?</i>), 
atmospheric forcing). Conversely, other ’perturbations’ <i>(use another word?)</i> may create 
spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions: the region exhibits 
complex topography  punctuated by submarine troughs and canyons 
which act to steer currents (Lagerloef 1983), and there is spatial heterogeneity
 in primary production, freshwater inputs, commercial harvest pressure, 
and the extent of the 1989 Exxon Valdez Oil Spill (add refs). Previous studies have
 used this complex topography for natural experiments based on the 
comparison of responses of selected fish species to natural or 
anthropogenic disturbance (Hollowed et al. 2007, Logerwell et al. 2007, 
Walline et al. 2012). The GoA groundfish assemblage, too, affords a suitable community in which
 to evaluate evidence for a spatial portfolio 
effect and potential underlying mechanisms. Groundfish in the GoA are well-studied and readily identified to 
species. Most are highly mobile (there is probably a range ...) and cosmopolitan across our study region,
 and are known to respond to perturbations (e.g. Anderson &amp; Piatt 1996, 
etc.), .<i>.. and anything else groundfish-y that could help us address 
hypothesized mechanisms for a spatial portfolio effect (eg functional traits?) ... Could cite 
Anne Hollowed’s work here?</i><br></div><div><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>To date, 
evaluating community-level spatial portfolio effects in natural settings
 has been limited by a lack of long-term, community-level data collected
 over large spatial scales (there has been only 1 such study: Mellin et 
al. 2014).<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The spatial portfolio effect really only
 refers to the stabilizing effect of [spatial turnover in species 
composition] on [temporal fluctuation of the regional metacommunity]. It
 does not rely on spatial invariance between local communities in alpha 
or beta (re saturation), and to my knowledge a spatial portfolio effect 
should not necessarily give rise to conserved alpha &amp; beta across 
local areas. So we should think about how to incorporate these into the 
spatial portfolio framework  - for example, can they tell us something 
about mechanisms underlying a spatial portfolio effect, or can we frame 
this in the context of community assembly theory? What does it mean, 
when considering the most abundant species as we do, that local areas 
seem to hold a constant (spatially invariant) number of species (ie 
constant alpha), a constant fraction of the regional species pool 
(beta),   and constant functional diversity, <u>despite</u> between-area
 differences in species composition, total community abundance, and some
 environmental variables (eg productivity, freshwater input)?&nbsp; Well, the
 fact that alpha is always much lower than gamma necessarily means that 
there will be high spatial turnover in species composition, which 
underlyies the spatial portfoltio effect ... but it's a chicken &amp; 
egg game: does low beta (low local saturation) give rise to high spatial
 turnover, or vice versa?&nbsp; This still doesn't address how spatial <u>invariance</u> in alpha &amp; beta plays into all of this ....<br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; We focused our study on examining patterns of diversity  and community composition in the GOA groundfish assemblage in the face of natural (e.g., climate regime shifts) and anthropogenic (e.g., EVOS) environmental perturbations (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

Fishing alone explained few GOA biomass trajectories; it was necessary to both estimate specific predator–prey relationships and provide some mechanism for increased production. No single control hypothesis explained all species dynamics simultaneously, suggesting that in the GOA, there is no single main driver of the ecosystem.
