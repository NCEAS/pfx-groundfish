evaluate the spatial structure  of diversity among the 
assemblage of the 52 most common groundfish species across the Gulf of 
Alaska. We assess the degree of between-local area differences in (i)
species richness, (ii) alpha diversity, (iii) functional diversity, and 
(iv) the degree 
to which local areas are saturated relative to the regional species 
pool (multiplicative beta diversity). We also assess the degree of spatial turnover in community 
composition. Finally, we evaluate evidence for a spatial portfolio 
effect: we assess how temporal variation in community abundance scales 
between local areas and the regional metacommunity.)&nbsp;</i> <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Main results; the spatial structure of diversity:</b><br></div><div><b>- species richness, alpha, beta (re. saturation), and functional diversity are conserved across space</b><br></div><div><b>-
 local communities show low (and statistically consistent?) saturation

communities held on average 1/7th to 1/10th of the regional species 
pool; among deep areas, local communities held on average 1/4th to 1/6th
 of the regional species pool (Figs 2x &amp; y).</b><br></div><div><b><b>- shallow areas were more diverse than deep areas (Bootstrapped gamma

 fact that saturation is low (ie high beta) necessarily means that 
there will be high spatial turnover in species composition, which 
underlies the spatial portfoltio effect ... however, note that this is a chicken &amp; 
egg game: does high beta (low local saturation) give rise to high spatial
 turnover, or vice versa?&nbsp; </i><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Most abundant species in shallow areas: Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut, Walleye pollock, Pacific cod. 
Deep: Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific ocean perch, Walleye pollock, 
Sablefish</i><br></div><div><u>'Redundancy' (replacement) among subdominant species.</u>
 In shallow areas 1-7 east of Kodiak (and to a lesser degree in deep 
areas 1-4), compositional turnover was driven by rare and 
intermediate-density species; community composition with respect to the 
most abundant species did not show spatial 
turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were 
transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; 
d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to 
allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure
 (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b). In 
other words, all the spatial turnover is going on at the level of less 
abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species 
(here, top predators) show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div><br></div><div>For shallow areas, PERMANOVA indicated that although both spatial and 
temporal processes had significant effects on community composition,
 between-area variation was greater than temporal variation in community
 composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4, respectively). For deep areas, 
between-area variation had similar importance to temporal variation (F =
 27.3 and 24.4, respectively).<br></div><div><br></div><div><b>c) Functional redundancy</b><br></div><div>- <u>Link to complementarity / redundancy hypothesis</u><br></div><div>- note that we selected functional 
traits to represent orthogonal components of community structure (size 
(and by extension the spatial scale of each species' biological 
interactions), longevity, trophic structure, use of benthic vs pelagic 
resources, habitat).&nbsp; <br></div><div>- Spatial turnover occurs among 
sub-dominant, not dominant, species 
... and constant functional diversity ... is there <u>redundancy among the sub-dominant species 
which are sequentially replaced along the longitudinal (environmental) 
gradient?</u><br></div><div><i>(ii)  interspecific interactions (e.g. trophic and non-trophic 
interactions, and behavioural responses to species interactions) which 
manifest at explicitly 
spatial scales  (e.g. competitive 
refugia / niche partitioning in space; Loreau &amp; de Mazancourt 2013, 
Wang &amp; Loreau 2014) <i>... note for when writing discussion: this will be related to our functional complementarity analysis</i></i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>d) Portfolio effect and the spatial scaling of ecosystem-level stability:</b><br></div><div>3 main components of stability: asynchrony (insurance
 hypothesis), diversity (portfolio effect), and total abundance. How do each of these components scale with space in GoA (ie local vs regional)?<br></div><div><div>Within local 
communities, instability (high CV) can arise from low diversity, large 
between-year fluctuations (high StDev) in abundance, or from low mean 
abundance. Greater temporal instability 
in local vs regional communities was associated with lower diversity in 
local vs regional communities (I think we can say 'associated with' 
because we see this pattern in both our shallow &amp; deep areas, kind 
of like having 2 replicates). StDev of total community abundance for each local area: range 16-45 (2.8-fold variation). Means of total community abundance: range 88 - 232 (2.6-fold 
variation) ... what does this 
tell us about what causes greater instabilities in local vs regional 
communities?<br></div><div><br></div><div>- How do all of the above components of diversity in our system build on each other to collectively 
create the spatial diversity-stability result (re ideas in Wang &amp; 
Loreau 2014 &amp; 2016, and pulling in ideas re mechanisms from the few 
empirical spatial diversity-stability papers published to date).

constant alpha), a constant fraction of the regional species pool 
(beta),   and constant functional diversity, </i><u><i>despite</i></u><i> between-area
 differences in species composition, total community abundance, and some
 environmental variables (eg productivity, freshwater input).</i><br></div><div>Are mutli-species sub-communities less variable than individual species? <i>(I think we're not addressing this question any more)</i><br></div><div>Does diversity (species and functional) convey stability across this LME? <i> (I don't think we can answer this without doing an analysis like  Mellin et al. 2014's Fig 2)</i><br></div><div>Does community composition alter community stability?&nbsp; <i>(between
 communities? see above, I don't think we can at present.&nbsp;&nbsp; Within

Fig.: NMDS), communities were unchanged over large spatial area and time
with respect to functional diversity and species richness, alpha 
diversity and beta diversity. [MH: It seems that beta diversity is the 
most interesting, so perhaps we should start with that diversity 
component followed by alpa diversity and species richness. Here is a 
good place to cite the Certain and Plangue paper and their findings on 
the importance of measuring beta diversity].<br></div><div>How the various components of diversity (alpha, beta (re 
saturation), gamma) in our data build on each other to collectively 
create the spatial diversity-stability result (re ideas in Wang &amp; 
Loreau 2014 &amp; 2016, and pulling in ideas re mechanisms from the few 
empirical spatial diversity-stability papers published to date). 
Probably 2-3 paragraphs on this.<br></div><div>Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across local areas, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div>Diversity is relatively constant across an expansive space.&nbsp; Each ecoregion supports a similar
level of species richness - but note difference between expected richness and raw species richness.&nbsp; <br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity were low relative to regional (gamma) 
diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low saturation
 relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp; y). [MH: We might 
add the caveat of gamma diversity - we/Ole selected the total # of 
species]. This could shed
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms. 
DEVELOP THIS FURTHER. This  concurs with results of NMDS, which 
indicated strong compositional turnover across study areas.<br></div><div>Additionally  we documented&nbsp; similar expected alpha (but not pure 
species richness) among all regions&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecoregions with the greatest total
 fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated from trawl data, had the 
lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the other groundfish 
paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I'm pretty sure 
total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top 
predator biomass.<br></div><div><br></div>
