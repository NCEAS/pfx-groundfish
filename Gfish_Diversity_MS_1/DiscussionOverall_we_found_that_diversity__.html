<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion<br></h1><div><i>Overall, we found that diversity and community structure were stable
across the central GOA.&nbsp;</i> Taxonomic and functional diversity varied
little at either local or regional spatial scales.&nbsp; Species richness
showed some variation longitudinally, while alpha diversity (exp<img>) was consistently low, and
beta diversity (<img>) and&nbsp;functional
diversity (Rao’s Q) were consistently high across the 10 study areas.&nbsp;
Community composition also varied longitudinally, driven by turnover of
lower-biomass species.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;only local diversity (species
richness and alpha) varied unimodally with disturbance (fishing
pressure).&nbsp; Thus, despite differences in species traits, disturbance,
community composition, and environmental variation, diversity and community
structure were stable across this large marine ecosystem, largely driven by
environmental heterogeneity (species sorting) and functional redundancy.&nbsp;<br></div><div><i>The spatial stability of these ecosystem properties was a surprise,
given the open, complex nature of this ecosystem.&nbsp;</i> Across this system,
local communities held a spatially stable number of species (stable alpha diversity),
a stable fraction of the regional species pool (beta diversity), and a stable
diversity of functions despite between-community differences in species
composition, total community abundance, and environmental conditions.&nbsp;
Conversely, we were surprised by the lack of stability (spatial turnover) in
community composition, despite environmental conditions that led us to expect
homogeneous composition across this large open ecosystem.&nbsp; Finally,
despite generally high primary productivity across the GOA, we did not find an
interaction between primary productivity and fishing disturbance, but only
found the expected effect of intermediate fishing disturbance on local species
richness and alpha diversity.&nbsp; However,
this effect was likely buffered by the spatial portfolio effect we observed at
the regional-community level.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Diversity</b><br></div><div><i>Despite small variations in species richness and functional diversity
across local communities, our diversity metrics together indicate that
community structure was conserved across the GOA.&nbsp;</i> Functional
diversity, computed from traits representing multiple uncorrelated elements of
community structure, was invariant, suggesting that local communities were
structured similarly with respect to functional roles and contained species
that were functionally redundant.&nbsp;<br></div><div><div><br></div><div>Discuss the Certain &amp; Planque paper here, re the importance of measuring
beta diversity?&nbsp;<br></div><br></div><div>a. We should compare to Mueter’s GoA diversity papers.<br></div><div><div><br></div><div>The small variation in species richness generally followed the longitudinal
gradient, with local communities 1 - 7 having lower richness, and local
communities 8 - 10 having slightly higher richness (Fig X, b).&nbsp; We found
statistically invariant (<i>do we know
this?)</i> alpha diversity, <b>indicating
that local communities had a similar degree of skew in relative abundance among
those species present in the community.</b>&nbsp; This result is corroborated
by a metric of community structure from our previous work (CITE Ole’s paper)<i>,</i> which indicated that local communities
are consistently dominated by apex predators, with similar ratios of predator
to prey abundance.&nbsp; Additionally, beta diversity was high&nbsp;in all
local communities but saturation was low (they each held 1/5<sup>th</sup> of
the regional species pool), reflecting compositional turnover.&nbsp; From
theory we know that if beta diversity is stable across space, then alpha
diversity and community saturation must be as well.&nbsp;<br></div><br></div><div><div><i>Local communities showed low saturation relative to the regional
species pool.</i>&nbsp; Local (alpha) diversity was low relative to regional
(gamma) diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low
saturation (containing on average 1/7<sup>th</sup> to 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the
regional species pool) relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp;
y).&nbsp; However, it is important to note that our determination of saturation
used calculated gamma diversity based on the multiplicative relationship
between alpha and beta diversity, which represented the effective number of
species. &nbsp; Therefore, despite initially selecting only the 57 (is this
right???) most common species from the raw trawl data for this study, our
calculated gamma diversity actually represented the number of equally abundant
species that would provide the same diversity as the 57 most common species in
this ecosystem.&nbsp; Because of the inherent relationship between alpha and
beta diversity, low saturation of local communities is reflected in the
relatively high beta diversity we observed, which likely arose from high
spatial turnover of community composition, which in turn likely arose from a
longitudinal gradient in environmental conditions (environmental
heterogeneity).&nbsp; But…<br></div><div>
Why would local communities be equally saturated across a spatially expansive
metacommunity? are all our local communities at the upper limit of species
richness (perhaps set by energy-limitation) Can we bring in theory about what
sets the degree of local saturation? Low saturation is also necessarily
associated with high spatial turnover in community composition (segue to next
section<br></div><div>
Low alpha and and low saturation (ie high beta diversity) of local communities
likely arose from high spatial turnover of community composition, which in turn
likely arose from a longitudinal gradient in environmental conditions
(environmental heterogeneity):<br></div><div>
[MH: Here is a good place to cite the Certain and Plangue paper and their
findings on the importance of measuring beta diversity].<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><b>Community Composition</b><br></div><div><div><i>Despite the presence of conditions which should facilitate strong
dispersal in our study system (an open ecosystem, mobile fish species, and the
strong Alaska Coastal Current), we observed turnover of composition between
local communities along a longitudinal (environmental) gradient.</i> &nbsp; Two
ecological mechanisms that could structure spatial patterns of community
composition include dispersal and environmental heterogeneity (CITE??), which
would lead to communities with the same composition or different composition
respectively.&nbsp; While compositional turnover has been observed in open
marine systems spatially along latitudinal gradients (e.g. coral-associated
fish: Mellin et al. 2014, fish assemblages of the North Sea prior to warming:
Magurran et al. 2015), few examples (<b>any?</b>)
exist documenting turnover along a longitudinal gradient.<br></div><div>
… insert text here to say that compositional turnover (changing species
identity) is expected along a latitudinal gradient from long-standing
biogeography hypotheses, and discuss whether there is precedent for this in
natural open marine systems NOT along latitudinal gradients.<br></div><div>
Consider citing evidence from the literature for conserved community structure
(with or without conserved species identity) across environmental gradients:
e.g. Sprules’ (2008) conserved biomass size spectra (conserved zooplankton
community structure over time in Lakes Erie and Ontario, and conserved
whole-food-web structure across an environmental gradient between 4 lakes).
Other studies?<br></div><div>
- nMDS shows community compositional turnover corresponds to a longitudinal
gradient: this suggests that species sorting (Whittaker 1962, Leibold et al.
2004) along an environmental gradient is the mechanism underlying spatial
turnover in community composition … in other words, environmental heterogeneity
is more important than dispersal in structuring our local communities despite
the fact that this is a completely open system, linked by the strong ACC, and
these are mobile species … remarkable. (consider citing <a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/93870/articles/114080/_show_article#Whittaker_1962">Whittaker

2004</a> for context)&nbsp; Is there precedent for this in an open system with
mobile species?<br></div><br></div><div><i>Intriguingly, we found that spatial turnover in community
composition&nbsp;along the longitudinal (environmental) gradient occurred among
subdominant (Fig. Z c, d) but not dominant (Fig. Z a, b) species.</i>&nbsp;
Turnover in community composition was not apparent when data were transformed
to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species (i.e. Hellinger
transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; d); instead, it was only apparent when data
were transformed to allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining
community structure (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a
&amp; b).&nbsp; The degree of turnover varied somewhat between our local study
areas, and was strongest in areas 1 - 7 and weaker towards sites 8 - 10 as
evidenced by reduced distances between centroids following the Hellinger
transformation (see Supp Figs).&nbsp; In other words, all the spatial turnover
occurred in the less abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most numerically
dominant species (here, top predators) showed similar spatial composition (w<b>e could check if this is supported by those
heat maps Ole created last year)</b><br></div><div><i>Numerically subdominant species were replaced along the longitudinal
gradient in such a way that they filled the same functional niche in each local
community.&nbsp;</i> At the same time, identity and community composition of
numerically dominant species (Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut, Walleye
pollock, Pacific cod) was invariant among easternmost sites, and less variable
than subdominant species among westernmost sites.&nbsp; This result, combined
with invariance in functional diversity and predator-prey ratios, suggests that
there was functional redundancy among sub-dominant species as they were
sequentially replaced along the longitudinal (environmental) gradient.<br></div><div><div>(ii) interspecific interactions
(e.g. trophic and non-trophic interactions, and behavioral responses to species
interactions) which manifest at explicitly spatial scales (e.g. competitive
refugia / niche partitioning in space; Loreau &amp; de Mazancourt 2013, Wang
&amp; Loreau 2014) … note for when writing discussion: this will be related to
our functional complementarity analysis<br></div><div>
c) Functional redundancy<br></div><div>
- Link to complementarity / redundancy hypothesis<br></div><div>
- note that we selected functional traits to represent orthogonal components of
community structure (size (and by extension the spatial scale of each species’
biological interactions), longevity, trophic structure, use of benthic vs
pelagic resources, habitat).&nbsp;<br></div><div>
NB: The fact that saturation is low (ie high beta) necessarily means that there
will be high spatial turnover in species composition, which underlies the
spatial portfoltio effect … however, note that this is a chicken &amp; egg
game: does high beta (low local saturation) give rise to high spatial turnover,
or vice versa?&nbsp;<br></div><div>
PERMANOVA indicated that although both spatial and temporal processes had
significant effects on community composition, between-area variation was
greater than temporal variation in community composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4,
respectively).<br></div><div>
Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying structure that is
conserved across local areas, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><b>Disturbance and Productivity</b><br></div><div><i>Despite the integral nature of the intermediate disturbance and
productivity hypotheses in ecological theory, we found no support for their
interaction.&nbsp;</i> This is potentially because the magnitude and sustained
nature of fishing pressure is so large across this ecosystem, and thus any
effects of productivity don’t play a strong role in structuring
diversity.&nbsp; We found support only for the intermediate disturbance effect
on local species richness and alpha diversity (exp<img>), with higher diversity
values at intermediate levels of fishing pressure.&nbsp; Beta diversity showed
a relationship with fishing pressure that was the inverse of the relationship
with alpha diversity, as expected (CITE).&nbsp;
However, functional diversity showed a more complex relationship.&nbsp; <b>ADD
SOMETHING ABOUT FOX’S ASSERTION THAT THE IDH HAS BE DISPROVED</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also found a surprising marginally
negative effect of primary productivity on alpha diversity, which could be due
to generalist predators consuming prey in proportion to their relative
abundance and causing local extirpations of less abundant species (CITE Hixon
and Beets 1993 Ecol Mono).&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Species
richness was greatest in local communities west of Kodiak Island (shallow
communities 8 and 9), where primary production (re. intensity and annual
duration of the Chl a ‘bloom’; Figs. 6a and 4 in Waite &amp; Mueter 2013),
total groundfish community abundance, and top predator abundance (Shelton et
al. 2017) were lowest.&nbsp; </b>Like other recent work (e.g. Adler et al. 2010
Science, Grace et al. 2014 Funct. Ecol.), <b>our
results stand in contrast to longstanding theory, which predicts that species
richness should exhibit a unimodal relationship (rise and then fall) with productivity
(Grimes 1973, 1979)</b>.&nbsp; We also found a significant positive
relationship between beta diversity and primary productivity, likely driven by
an increasingly patchy pattern as primary productivity increased, leading to
larger differences in diversity between local communities.&nbsp; Differential
responses to disturbance and environmental conditions such as these are a
primary mechanism underlying the spatial portfolio effect (CITE Want &amp;
Loreau, etc, etc).&nbsp;<br></div><div><i>The portfolio effect can buffer communities temporally against
ecosystem perturbations (CITES).&nbsp;</i> But, we found support for a spatial
portfolio effect across this large marine ecosystem despite spatially stable
diversity, as shown by greater temporal stability in local vs regional
communities associated with higher diversity in local vs regional communities.
&nbsp; Inter-annual changes in local community abundance ranged from 16-45 (2.8
fold variation), while overall community abundance ranged from 88-232 (2.6 fold
variation). &nbsp;Within local communities, stability
(lower CV) can arise from high diversity, small inter-annual fluctuations (small
standard deviation (SD)) in abundance, or from high mean abundance. &nbsp;The comparatively small inter-annual variation
in abundance likely contributes to the spatial stability of this ecosystem in
the face of perturbations. &nbsp;The
importance of environmental heterogeneity (species sorting) and functional
complementarity mechanisms underlying spatial patterns of high beta diversity
and turnover in community composition may contribute to the spatial portfolio
effect and buffer the regional Gulf of Alaska groundfish community against
perturbations.&nbsp; <br></div><div><div><br></div><div>How the various components of diversity (alpha, beta (re saturation), gamma) in
our data build on each other to collectively create the spatial
diversity-stability result (re ideas in Wang &amp; Loreau 2014 &amp; 2016, and
pulling in ideas re mechanisms from the few empirical spatial diversity-stability
papers published to date). Probably 2-3 paragraphs on this.<br></div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>Ecoregions with the greatest total fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated
from trawl data, had the lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the
other groundfish paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I’m pretty
sure total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top
predator biomass.<br></div><div>

areas show a U-shaped relationship with primary productivity.<br></div><div>

communities held a stable (spatially invariant) number of species (stable
