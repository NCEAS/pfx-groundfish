<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion<br></h1><div><div><div><div><br></div><div><i>Overall, we found that diversity and community structure were stable across the central GOA.&nbsp;</i> Taxanomic and functional diversity varied little at either local or regional spatial scales.&nbsp; Species richness showed some variation longitudinally, while alpha diversity (exp<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="H" contenteditable="false">\(H\)</span>) was consistently low, and beta diversity (<span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span>) and&nbsp;functional diversity (Rao's Q) were consistently high across the 10 study areas.&nbsp; Community composition also varied longitudinally, driven by turnover of lower-biomass species.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;only local diversity (species richness and alpha) varied unimodally with disturbance (fishing pressure).&nbsp; Thus, despite differences in species traits, disturbance, community composition, and environmental variation,  diversity and community 
structure were stable across this large marine ecosystem,
largely driven by environmental heterogeneity (species sorting) and 
functional redundancy.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><i>The spatial stability of these ecosystem properties was a surprise, given the open, complex nature of this ecosystem.&nbsp; </i>Across this system, local communities held a spatially stable number of species (stable alpha diversity), a stable fraction of the regional species pool (beta diversity), and a stable diversity of functions despite between-community differences in species composition, total community abundance, and environmental conditions.&nbsp; Conversely, we were surprised by the lack of stability (spatial turnover) in community composition, despite environmental conditions that led us to expect homogeneous composition across this large open ecosystem.&nbsp; Finally, despite generally high primary productivity across the GOA, we did not find an interaction between primary productivity and fishing disturbance, but only found the expected effect of intermediate fishing disturbance on local species richness and alpha diversity.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Diversity</b><br></div><div><i>Despite small variations in species richness and functional diversity across local communities, our diversity metrics together indicate that community structure was conserved across the GOA.&nbsp; </i>Functional diversity, computed from traits
representing multiple uncorrelated elements of community
structure, was invariant, suggesting that
local communities were structured similarly with respect to functional
roles and contained species that were functionally redundant.&nbsp; <br></div><div>Discuss the Certain &amp; Planque paper here, re the importance of measuring beta diversity?&nbsp; <br></div><div>The small variation in species richness  generally followed the longitudinal gradient, with local communities 1 - 7 having lower richness, and local communities 8 - 10 having slightly higher richness (Fig X, b).&nbsp; We found statistically invariant (<i>do we know this?)</i> alpha diversity,<b> indicating that local communities
had a similar degree of skew in relative abundance among those species present
in the community.</b>&nbsp; This result is corroborated by a metric of community
structure from our previous work (CITE Ole's paper)<i>,</i> which indicated that local communities
are consistently dominated by apex predators, with similar ratios of predator to
prey abundance.&nbsp; Additionally, beta diversity was high&nbsp;in all local
communities but saturation was low (they each held 1/5<sup>th</sup>
 of the regional species pool), reflecting compositional turnover.&nbsp; From theory we know that if beta diversity is stable across space, then alpha diversity and community saturation must be as well.&nbsp; <br></div><div><div><br></div><div><i>Local communities showed low saturation relative to the regional species pool.</i>&nbsp; Local (alpha) diversity was low relative to regional (gamma) 
diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low saturation
(containing on average 1/7<sup>th</sup> to 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the regional species 
pool) relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp; y).&nbsp; Our determination of saturation used calculated gamma diversity based on the multiplicative relationship between alpha and beta diversity, which represented the effective number of species. &nbsp; Therefore, despite initially selecting only the 57 (is this right???) most common species from the raw trawl data for this study, our calculated gamma diversity actually represented the number of equally abundant species that would provide the same diversity as the 57 most common species in this ecosystem.&nbsp; Because of the inherent relationship between alpha and beta diversity, low saturation of local communities is reflected in the relatively high beta diversity we observed, which likely
 arose from high spatial turnover of community composition, which in 
turn likely arose from a longitudinal gradient in environmental 
conditions 
(environmental heterogeneity).&nbsp; But...<br></div><div><br></div><div>Why would local communities be <u>equally</u> saturated across a 
spatially expansive metacommunity? are all our local communities at the 
upper limit of species richness (perhaps set by energy-limitation) Can 
we bring in theory about what sets the degree of local saturation? Low 
saturation is also necessarily associated with high spatial turnover in 
community composition (segue to next section<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div><br></div><div>Low alpha and

has been observed in open marine systems spatially along latitudinal gradients (e.g.
coral-associated fish: Mellin et al. 2014, fish assemblages of the North Sea
prior to warming: Magurran et al. 2015), few examples (<b>any?</b>) exist documenting turnover along a longitudinal gradient. <br></div><div><br></div><div>... insert text here to say

citing evidence from the literature for conserved community structure (with or
without conserved species identity) across environmental gradients: e.g.

 community compositional turnover corresponds to a 
longitudinal gradient: this suggests that species sorting (Whittaker 
1962, Leibold et al. 2004) along an 
environmental gradient is the mechanism underlying spatial turnover in 
community composition ... in other words, environmental heterogeneity is
 more important than dispersal in structuring our local communities

strong ACC, and these are mobile species ... remarkable.</u> (consider

subdominant (Fig. Z c, d) but not dominant (Fig. Z a, b) species.</i>&nbsp; Turnover in community composition was not apparent when 
data were 
transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species 
(i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; 
d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to 
allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure
 (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b).&nbsp; The 
degree of turnover varied somewhat between our study areas, and was 
strongest in areas 1 - 7 and weaker towards sites 8 - 10 as evidenced by
 reduced distances between centroids following the
Hellinger transformation (see Supp Figs).&nbsp; In 
other words, all the spatial turnover occurred in the less 
abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species

numerically dominant species (Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific
halibut, Walleye pollock, Pacific cod) was invariant among easternmost sites, and less
variable than subdominant species among westernmost sites.&nbsp; This result,
combined with invariance in functional diversity and predator-prey ratios,
suggests that there was functional
redundancy among sub-dominant species as they were sequentially
replaced along the longitudinal (environmental) gradient. <br><br><div>(ii)  interspecific interactions (e.g. trophic and non-trophic

both our shallow &amp; deep areas, kind of like having 2 replicates).&nbsp; A primary mechanism underlying the
spatial portfolio effect is speciesâ€™ differential responses to environmental
conditions and perturbations (Wang &amp; Loreau 2014, definitely cite other lit
