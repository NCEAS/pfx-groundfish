<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Discussion<br></h1><div>1) Overview of our main results and why they are important.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><i>(Purpose statement for Intro:</i><br></div><div><i>Here we 
evaluate the spatial structure  of diversity among the 
assemblage of the 52 most common groundfish species across the Gulf of 
Alaska. We assess the degree of between-local area differences in (i)
species richness, (ii) alpha diversity, (iii) functional diversity, and 
(iv) the degree 
to which local areas are saturated relative to the regional species 
pool. We also assess the degree of spatial turnover in community 
composition. Finally, we evaluate evidence for a spatial portfolio 
effect: we assess how temporal variation in community abundance scales 
between local areas and the regional metacommunity.)&nbsp;</i> <br></div><div><br></div><div>The spatial structure of diversity:<br></div><div>- species richness, alpha, beta (re. saturation), and functional diversity are conserved across space<br></div><div>- there is significant spatial turnover in community composition. This turnover occurs among numerically sub-dominant species but not among numerically dominant species. Turnover occurs along a longitudinal gradient.<br></div><div>-
 there is evidence for a spatial portfolio effect: for both shallow and deep communities, the regional 
metacommunity shows reduced temporal variation in community abundance 
relative to local communities. Scaling is &gt;1, indicating a stabilizing (ie portfolio) effect.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Getting some rough thoughts down on 'paper':<br></div><div>- most important and novel results to discuss: (i) lack of variation in beta (the degree to which local communities are saturated), and (ii) evidence for a spatial portfolio effect at the whole-community level<br></div><div><br></div><div>- I think the lack of variation in alpha between local communities per se is not the interesting result - I think this simply arises from the fact that beta (local saturation, ie what fraction of the regional metacommunity coexists in each local community) does not differ between local communities, and I think THAT is what's more interesting ... if beta does not change between local communities, then alpha can not change either, and vice versa.<br></div><div><br></div><div>- ultimately, low alpha and beta (saturation) probably arise from high spatial turnover of community composition, which is probably due to a longitudinal gradient in environmental conditions:<br></div><div><br></div><div>- nMDS shows community compositional turnover corresponds to a 
longitudinal gradient: this suggests that species sorting (along an 
environmental gradient) is the mechanism underlying spatial turnover in 
community composition ... in other words, environmental is more important than dispersal in structuring communities (consider citing <cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="@article{Whittaker_1962,

 fact that beta (saturation) is low necessarily means that 
there will be high spatial turnover in species composition, which 
underlies the spatial portfoltio effect ... however, note that this is a chicken &amp; 
egg game: does low beta (low local saturation) give rise to high spatial
 turnover, or vice versa?&nbsp; Why would local communities be <u>equally</u> saturated across a large metacommunity? upper limit on species richness at higher latitudes or in energy-limited environments?<br></div><div><br></div><div>- spatial portfolio effect: previously documented among metapopulations (eg Schindler); little work documenting this phenomenon at the whole-community level  (eg Mellin et al. 2014, Wang &amp; Loreau 2014)<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>What does it mean that among the most abundant species, local communities hold a constant (spatially invariant) number of species (ie

 In shallow areas 1-7 east of Kodiak (and to a lesser degree in deep 
areas 1-4), compositional turnover was driven by rare and 
intermediate-density species; community composition with respect to the 
most abundant species (probably Arrowtooth) did not show spatial 
turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were 
transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species such
 as Arrowtooth Flounder (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; 
d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to 
allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure
 (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b). In 
other words, all the spatial change is going on at the level of less 
abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species 
(here, top predators) show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div>Despite the fact that this is a completely open system, and despite
 that we are working with mobile species, we document 
remarkably high turnover in community composition between ecoregions 
along a longitudinal gradient. Is there precedent for this? <br></div><div><i>(This
 text in parentheses, which tries to understand why, is probably beyond 
the scope of this paper: Admittedly, I'm biased towards a 
productivity-driven answer because that is my background. Nevertheless, I
 really wonder if this is all driven by a productivity gradient, which matches these results: lowest productivity areas
 (west of Kodiak &amp; Shelikof) have lowest predator (arrowtooth) 
biomass and highest species richness; conversely, highest productivity 
areas (just east of Kodiak) have highest predator (including arrowtooth)
 biomass and lowest species richness. From a Lotka-Volterra model, 
predator biomass should accumulate the most in highest productivity 
areas. Strong 
predation pressure can / should facilitate coexistence (ie greater species 
richness), however the pattern is the opposite here ... . Community compositional turnover suggests strong species 
sorting along an environmental gradient (here, a productivity gradient).<i>&nbsp;
 Also, how does the spatial extent of our entire region (all 9 &amp; 5
 areas) compare with movement/mobility of lower vs upper trophic 
level species? Thinking about how mobile predators should couple across 
these regions, creating synchrony / asynchrony ... For all of these 
reasons I think it could be super cool to look at food web dynamics 
across our sub areas, if anyone is interested&nbsp; ... :)&nbsp; </i>)</i><br></div><div><i><i><i>(<i>For
 both shallow and deep study areas, 3/4 of the most dominant species 
were top predators (Shallow areas: Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut,
 Pollock (not a predator), and Pacific cod; Deep areas: Arrowtooth 
flounder, Pacific ocean perch, Pollock, and Sablefish). When only the 
most dominant species were allowed to contribute to the
 ordination (ie substituting a Hellinger transformation for a 
wisconsin-square root transformation)</i>, spatial turnover was not 
apparent among eastern shallow areas (regions 1-7) and diminished among 
eastern deep areas (regions 1-4). This suggests that, among eastern 
areas, spatial turnover in community composition was driven by 
subdominant (but not dominant) species) - in other words, top predators 
showed spatial stability while subdominant species (a mix of predator 
and prey species) did not.) &nbsp; </i></i></i><br></div><div><i><i><i><i>For either discussion: For shallow areas, PERMANOVA indicated <i>that although both spatial and temporal processes had significant effects on community composition</i>,
 between-area variation was greater than temporal variation in community
 composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4, respectively). For deep areas, 
between-area variation had similar importance to temporal variation (F =
 27.3 and 24.4, respectively).</i></i></i></i><br></div><div><br></div><div>5) Diversity across a LME - why we saw stability, and is that what we expected?<br></div><div>Despite strong spatial compositional turnover  (west-east gradient; 
Fig.: NMDS), communities were unchanged over large spatial area and time
with respect to functional diversity and species richness, alpha 
diversity and beta diversity. [MH: It seems that beta diversity is the 
most interesting, so perhaps we should start with that diversity 
component followed by alpa diversity and species richness. Here is a 
good place to cite the Certain and Plangue paper and their findings on 
the importance of measuring beta diversity].<br></div><div>How the various components of diversity (alpha, beta (re 
saturation), gamma) in our data build on each other to collectively 
create the spatial diversity-stability result (re ideas in Wang &amp; 
Loreau 2014 &amp; 2016, and pulling in ideas re mechanisms from the few 
empirical spatial diversity-stability papers published to date). 
Probably 2-3 paragraphs on this.<br></div><div>Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across local areas, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div>Diversity is relatively constant across an expansive space.&nbsp; Each ecoregion supports a similar
level of species richness - but note difference between expected richness and raw species richness.&nbsp; <br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity were low relative to regional (gamma) 
diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low saturation
 relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp; y). [MH: We might 
add the caveat of gamma diversity - we/Ole selected the total # of 
species]. This could shed
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms. 
DEVELOP THIS FURTHER. This  concurs with results of NMDS, which 
indicated strong compositional turnover across study areas.<br></div><div>Additionally  we documented&nbsp; similar expected alpha (but not pure 
species richness) among all regions&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecoregions with the greatest total
 fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated from trawl data, had the 
lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the other groundfish 
paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I'm pretty sure 
total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top 
predator biomass. &nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>6) Link to the other  papers:<br></div><div>e.g. Ole's feeding 
guilds result - how does this link to (i) our functional diversity 
result, and (ii) the dominant vs subdominant result (dominant apex preds
 do not show spatial variability, subdominant prey do)<br></div><div>Llinks to ichthyoplankton project?<br></div><div><div><br></div><div>7) Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across study areas, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Sketching out some REALLY rough thoughts:</i><br></div><div>Idea of a <b>diversity cascade</b>, and idea of portfolio effect driven by predation pressure (one of many hypotheses for portfolio effect). Perhaps this 'redundancy'(<i>again, probably the wrong word!)</i> is driven by predator release of diversity (ie greater top predator biomass (which necessarily translates into stronger top-down pressure)?&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div>
