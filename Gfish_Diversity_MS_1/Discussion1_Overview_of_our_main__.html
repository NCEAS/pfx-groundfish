 In shallow areas 1-7 east of Kodiak (and to a lesser degree in deep 
areas 1-4), compositional turnover was driven by rare and 
intermediate-density species; community composition with respect to the 
most abundant species (probably Arrowtooth) did not show spatial 
turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were 
transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species such
 as Arrowtooth Flounder (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; 
d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to 
allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure
 (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b). In 
other words, all the spatial change is going on at the level of less 
abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species 
(here, top predators) show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div><br></div><div>5) Diversity across a LME - why we saw stability, and is that what we expected?<br></div><div>Despite strong spatial compositional turnover  (west-east gradient; 
Fig.: NMDS), communities were unchanged over large spatial area and time
with respect to functional diversity and species richness, alpha 
diversity and beta diversity. [MH: It seems that beta diversity is the 
most interesting, so perhaps we should start with that diversity 
component followed by alpa diversity and species richness. Here is a 
good place to cite the Certain and Plangue paper and their findings on 
the importance of measuring beta diversity].<br></div><div>How the various components of diversity (alpha, beta (re 
saturation), gamma) in our data build on each other to collectively 
create the spatial diversity-stability result (re ideas in Wang &amp; 
Loreau 2014 &amp; 2016, and pulling in ideas re mechanisms from the few 
empirical spatial diversity-stability papers published to date). 
Probably 2-3 paragraphs on this.<br></div><div>Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across local areas, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div>Diversity is relatively constant across an expansive space.&nbsp; Each ecoregion supports a similar
level of species richness - but note difference between expected richness and raw species richness.&nbsp; <br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity were low relative to regional (gamma) 
diversity - in other words, local communities showed very low saturation
 relative to the regional species pool (Figs. x &amp; y). [MH: We might 
add the caveat of gamma diversity - we/Ole selected the total # of 
species]. This could shed
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms. 
DEVELOP THIS FURTHER. This  concurs with results of NMDS, which 
indicated strong compositional turnover across study areas.<br></div><div><br></div><div>6) Link to the other  papers:<br></div><div>e.g. Ole's feeding

diversity): Functionally, communities are unchanged over space and time.</b><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Sketching out some REALLY rough thoughts:</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Idea of a <b>diversity cascade</b>, and idea of portfolio effect driven by predation pressure (one of many hypotheses for portfolio effect). Perhaps this 'redundancy'(<i>again, probably the wrong word!)</i> is driven by predator release of diversity (ie greater top predator biomass (which necessarily translates into stronger top-down pressure)?&nbsp; <br></div><div>Additionally (this is not related to idea of redundancy) we documented&nbsp; similar expected alpha (but not pure species richness) among all regions&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecoregions with the greatest total fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated from trawl data, had the lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the other groundfish paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I'm pretty sure total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top predator biomass ... <br></div><div><br></div><div>Despite the fact that this is a completely open system, and despite
 that we are working with mobile species, we document 
remarkably high turnover in community composition between ecoregions 
along a longitudinal gradient. Is there precedent for this? <br></div><div><i>(This
 text in parentheses, which tries to understand why, is probably beyond 
the scope of this paper: Admittedly, I'm biased towards a 
productivity-driven answer because that is my background. Nevertheless, I
 really wonder if this is all driven by a productivity gradient, which matches these results: lowest productivity areas
 (west of Kodiak &amp; Shelikof) have lowest predator (arrowtooth) 
biomass and highest species richness; conversely, highest productivity 
areas (just east of Kodiak) have highest predator (including arrowtooth)
 biomass and lowest species richness. From a Lotka-Volterra model, 
predator biomass should accumulate the most in highest productivity 
areas. Strong 
predation pressure can / should facilitate coexistence (ie greater species 
richness), however the pattern is the opposite here ... . Community compositional turnover suggests strong species 
sorting along an environmental gradient (here, a productivity gradient).<i>&nbsp; Also, how does the spatial extent of our entire region (all 9 &amp; 5
 areas) compare with movement/mobility of lower vs upper trophic 
level species? Thinking about how mobile predators should couple across these regions, creating synchrony / asynchrony ... For all of these reasons I think it could be super cool to look at food web dynamics across our sub areas, if anyone is interested&nbsp; ... :)&nbsp; </i>)</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><i><i>(<i>For
 both shallow and deep study areas, 3/4 of the most dominant species 
were top predators (Shallow areas: Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut,
 Pollock (not a predator), and Pacific cod; Deep areas: Arrowtooth 
flounder, Pacific ocean perch, Pollock, and Sablefish). When only the 
most dominant species were allowed to contribute to the
 ordination (ie substituting a Hellinger transformation for a 
wisconsin-square root transformation)</i>, spatial turnover was not 
apparent among eastern shallow areas (regions 1-7) and diminished among 
eastern deep areas (regions 1-4). This suggests that, among eastern 
areas, spatial turnover in community composition was driven by 
subdominant (but not dominant) species) - in other words, top predators 
showed spatial stability while subdominant species (a mix of predator 
and prey species) did not.) &nbsp; </i></i><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div>
