<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Large environmental perturbations<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the time span of this study (1984 - 2015), the GOA experienced several large-scale climate and oceanographic perturbations that could have affected groundfish communities. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Diversity and stability<br></h2><div>species richness<br></div><div>blah, blah, blah<br></div><div><br>Alpha and Beta diversity<br></div><div>Alpha and beta diversity were remarkably similar across shallow areas  (Figure 3x,y ). Our estimates of these diversity components were similar across deep areas as well, although the western portion of Shelikof Strait (area 3) differed somewhat from the other deep areas (Figure 3x,y). Species richness was consistent among all shallow areas east of Kodiak Island (area1 1-7), but was higher in areas west of Kodiak Island (areas 8-9). In the deep areas, species richness was highest along Kodiak Island and west of the Island (areas 3-5) and lowest in the Shelikof Strait and east of Kodiak Island (areas 1 and 2).<br></div><div><br></div><div>Functional diversity<br></div><div>Rao's Q was similar among most shallow and deep study areas (Fig. 3f,g), with the exception of a few shallow areas:  a Tukey test indicated significant pairwise differences between shallow areas 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, and 9-2 (p &lt; 0.05). For deep study areas, a 1-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences in Rao's Q between areas (p = 0.071).<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Community composition <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FD depends on who is there, to a large extent, so we examined community composition.&nbsp; <br></div><div>NMDS
 indicated spatial turnover in community composition in both shallow
 and deep study areas along a longitudinal gradient (Fig. 4). For both 
shallow and deep areas, PERMANOVA indicated that between-area 
differences were significant (Shallow: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222; Deep: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>= 0.23) and a test of homogeneity of within-area dispersions affirmed 
that PERMANOVA results were attributable to real between-area 
differences in community composition (Shallow: p = 0.94, Deep: p = 
0.89). <br></div><div><i>For either results or discussion: For shallow areas, PERMANOVA indicated <i>that although both spatial and temporal processes had significant effects on community composition</i>,
 between-area variation was greater than temporal variation in community
 composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4, respectively). For deep areas, 
between-area variation had similar importance to temporal variation (F =
 27.3 and 24.4, respectively).</i><br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Portfolio Effect <br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tested the whether there was more variation among individual study areas vs. the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>CVs of the regional metacommunity (shallow sites 0.073; deep sites 
0.187) were lower than mean CVs of local communities (shallow sites 
0.171 +- 0.043; deep sites 0.253 +- 0.077; Fig. 3). Mean local community
 CV was greater than regional CV by a factor of 2.34 in shallow sites 
and a factor of 1.35 in deep sites.<br></div><br></div><div><br></div><div>List of Figures &amp; Tables: <br></div><div>Figure 1:&nbsp; Map of shallow and deep study areas and EVOS spill <br></div><div>Figure 2: Diversity metrics;&nbsp; 8 panels - sp. richness, FD, alpha, beta - for shallow and deep areas <br></div><div>Figure 3: Community Composition; NMDS plots with hulls connecting years for a given study area<br></div><div>Figure 4:<b>&nbsp; </b>Spatial CV plots<b> </b><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
