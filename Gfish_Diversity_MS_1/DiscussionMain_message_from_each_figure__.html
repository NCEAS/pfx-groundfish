level of species richness - but note difference between expected richness and raw species richness - WE SHOULD DECIDE WHICH TO SHOW.<br></div><div>By the way, how saturated is each area? (ie comparison to
gamma diversity; I’m not sure how to interpret expected richness relative to
gamma diversity). Whether they’re all close to the regional species richness,
or conversely all fall well below regional species richness, I think this sheds
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity seem low relative to regional (gamma) diversity. This beta diversity result concurs with results of nMDS, which indicated strong compositional turnover across ecoregions.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Fig. 5 (functional

structure that is conserved across ecoregions, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div>
