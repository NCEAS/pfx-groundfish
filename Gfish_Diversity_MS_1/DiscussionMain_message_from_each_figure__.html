This could shed
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms. DEVELOP THIS FURTHER. This  concurs with results of nMDS, which indicated strong compositional turnover across ecoregions.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Fig. 5 (functional
diversity): Functionally, communities are unchanged over space and time.</b><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Sketching out some REALLY rough thoughts:</i><br></div><div>Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across ecoregions, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div><br></div><div>Another type of portfolio effect: 'redundancy' (replacement) among subdominant species (<i>redundancy is probably not exactly the right concept here</i>).  Compositional turnover was driven by rare and intermediate-density species; community composition with respect to the most abundant species (probably Arrowtooth) did not show spatial turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species such as Arrowtooth Flounder (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Figs. 6 c &amp; d); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to allow subdominant species equal chance of explaining community structure (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figs. 6 a &amp; b). In other words, all the spatial change is going on at the level of less abundant lower trophic-level species, while the most abundant species (here, top predators) show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div>LIST THE 5 OR 10 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES.<br></div><div>Idea of a <b>diversity cascade</b>, and idea of portfolio effect driven by predation pressure (one of many hypotheses for portfolio effect). Perhaps this 'redundancy'(<i>again, probably the wrong word!)</i> is driven by predator release of diversity (ie greater top predator biomass (which necessarily translates into stronger top-down pressure)?&nbsp; <br></div><div>Additionally (this is not related to idea of redundancy) we documented&nbsp; similar expected alpha (but not pure species richness) among all regions&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecoregions with the greatest total fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated from trawl data, had the lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the other groundfish paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I'm pretty sure total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top predator biomass ... <br></div><div><br></div><div>Despite the fact that this is a completely open system, and despite
 that we are working with mobile species, we document 
remarkably high turnover in community composition between ecoregions 
along a longitudinal gradient. Is there precedent for this? <br></div><div><i>(This
 text in parentheses, which tries to understand why, is probably beyond 
the scope of this paper: Admittedly, I'm biased towards a 
productivity-driven answer because that is my background. Nevertheless, I
 really wonder if this is all driven by a productivity gradient, which matches these results: lowest productivity areas
 (west of Kodiak &amp; Shelikof) have lowest predator (arrowtooth) 
biomass and highest species richness; conversely, highest productivity 
areas (just east of Kodiak) have highest predator (including arrowtooth)
 biomass and lowest species richness. From a Lotka-Volterra model, 
predator biomass should accumulate the most in highest productivity 
areas. Strong 
predation pressure can / should facilitate coexistence (ie greater species 
richness), however the pattern is the opposite here ... . Community compositional turnover suggests strong species 
sorting along an environmental gradient (here, a productivity gradient).<i>&nbsp; Also, how does the spatial extent of our entire region (all 9 &amp; 5
 areas) compare with movement/mobility of lower vs upper trophic 
level species? Thinking about how mobile predators should couple across these regions, creating synchrony / asynchrony ... For all of these reasons I think it could be super cool to look at food web dynamics across our sub areas, if anyone is interested&nbsp; ... :)&nbsp; </i>)</i><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div>
