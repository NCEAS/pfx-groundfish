gamma diversity; I’m not sure how to interpret expected richness relative to
gamma diversity). Whether they’re all close to the regional species richness,
or conversely all fall well below regional species richness, I think this sheds
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Both alpha and beta diversity seem low relative to regional (gamma) diversity. This beta diversity result concurs with results of nMDS, which indicated strong compositional turnover across ecoregions.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div><i>Just sketching out some rough thoughts:</i><br></div><div>Another type of portfolio effect: 'redundancy' among rare and medium density species (<i>redundancy is probably not exactly the right concept here</i>).  Compositional turnover was driven by rare and medium density species; community composition with respect to the most abundant species (probably Arrowtooth) did not show spatial turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were transformed to emphasize the influence of the most abundant species such as Arrowtooth Flounder (i.e. Hellinger transformation; Fig. 6b); instead, turnover was only apparent when data were transformed to allow rare and medium-density species equal chance of explaining community structure (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Fig. 6a). In other words, all the spatial change is going on at the level of lower trophic-level species, while top predators show similar spatial composition (<i>we could check if this is supported by those heat maps Ole created last year</i>).<br></div><div>Idea of a <b>diversity cascade</b>, and idea of portfolio effect driven by predation pressure (one of many hypotheses for portfolio effect). I wonder if this 'redundancy'(<i>again, probably the wrong word!)</i> is driven by predator release of diversity (ie greater top predator biomass (which necessarily translates into stronger top-down pressure) &nbsp;&nbsp; similar expected alpha (but not pure species richness) among all regions&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecoregions with the greatest total fish biomass (regions 1-7), as estimated from trawl data, had the lowest pure species richness, and vice versa (cite the other groundfish paper for biomass results: Shelton et al. in prep). I suspect total fish biomass is driven by Arrowtooth Flounder biomass, ie top predator biomass.&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Fig. 5 (functional
