though species identity changed (somewhat) over space (west-east gradient; Fig.
6 (PCA or nMDS)), communities were unchanged over (massive!) space and time,

Diversity is relatively constant across (massive!) space.</b><br></div><div>Fig. 3 (alpha diversity): Each ecoregion supports a similar
level of species richness. <br></div><div>By the way, how saturated is each area? (ie comparison to
gamma diversity; I’m not sure how to interpret expected richness relative to
gamma diversity). Whether they’re all close to the regional species richness,
or conversely all fall well below regional species richness, I think this sheds
interesting light on our results and potential underlying mechanisms<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>Fig. 4 (beta diversity): Ecoregions are similar
(compositionally? or in terms of each one’s richness?) to each other.<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>How do we reconcile that Beta diversity is high (do I recall
that correctly?) between ecoregions (ie similar species composition), yet PCA
and nMDS showed compositional turnover between (larger) ecoregions (ie along
the West-East gradient)?<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>Fig. 5 (functional
diversity): Functionally, communities are unchanged over space and time.</b><br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b><br></div><div>Overall, do our results point to some fundamental underlying
structure that is conserved across ecoregions, despite turnover in species identity?<br></div><div>&nbsp;<br></div>
