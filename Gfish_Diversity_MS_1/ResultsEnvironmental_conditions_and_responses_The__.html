 ordination (ie substituting a Hellinger transformation for a 
wisconsin-square root transformation)</i>, spatial turnover was not apparent among eastern shallow regions (regions 1-7) and diminished among eastern deep regions (regions 1-4). This suggests that, among eastern regions, spatial turnover in community composition was driven by subdominant (but not dominant) species). &nbsp; </i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>List of Figures &amp; Tables: <br></div><div>Supplement Table S1: table of area, mean depth, bottom temp, # of modeled grid cells, etc. <br></div><div>Figure 1: Map of shallow and deep study areas and EVOS spill from Blake Feist<br></div><div>Figure 2: individual species vs. whole community plot<br></div><div>Figure 3: Diversity metrics;&nbsp; 8 panels - sp. richness, FD, alpha, beta - for shallow and deep areas <br></div><div>Figure 4: Community Composition; NMDS plots with hulls connecting years for a given study area<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
