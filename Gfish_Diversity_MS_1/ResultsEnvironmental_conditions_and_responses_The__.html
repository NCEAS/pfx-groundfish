 indicated spatial turnover in community composition in both shallow
 and deep study areas along a longitudinal gradient (Fig. 4). For both 
shallow and deep areas, PERMANOVA indicated that between-area 
differences were significant (Shallow: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222; Deep: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>

that PERMANOVA results were attributable to real between-area 
differences in community composition (Shallow: p = 0.94, Deep: p = 
0.89). <br></div><div><i>For either results or discussion: For shallow areas, PERMANOVA indicated <i>that although both spatial and temporal processes had significant effects on community composition</i>,
 between-area variation was greater than temporal variation in community
 composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4, respectively). For deep areas, 
between-area variation had similar importance to temporal variation (F =
 27.3 and 24.4, respectively).</i><br></div><div><br></div><div><i>(<i>For
 both shallow and deep study areas, 3/4 of the most dominant species 
were top predators (Shallow areas: Arrowtooth flounder, Pacific halibut,
 Pollock (not a predator), and Pacific cod; Deep areas: Arrowtooth 
flounder, Pacific ocean perch, Pollock, and Sablefish). When only the 
most dominant species were allowed to contribute to the
 ordination (ie substituting a Hellinger transformation for a 
wisconsin-square root transformation)</i>, spatial turnover was not 
apparent among eastern shallow areas (regions 1-7) and diminished among 
eastern deep areas (regions 1-4). This suggests that, among eastern 
areas, spatial turnover in community composition was driven by 
subdominant (but not dominant) species) - in other words, top predators 
showed spatial stability while subdominant species (a mix of predator 
and prey species) did not.) &nbsp; </i><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection"><i>Spatial stability</i><br></h2><div><b><i>Spatial stability in (species? whole community?)
