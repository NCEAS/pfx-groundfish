<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Diversity and stability<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing the ecological theory behind the diversity-stability relationship, we wanted to examine the mechanisms supporting this relationship in the groundfish community in the GOA.&nbsp; We began by examining a few diversity metrics within each of the 9 shallow and 5 deep study areas to understand how diversity varied across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; Species richness at each study area was relatively low (across the 31 years), and ranged from approx. 9 - 13 in shallow areas and 11 - 14 in deep areas with the largest difference between any two sites just 4 species (Figure 2 a, b).&nbsp; Western-most shallow sites (# 8, 9) had higher species richness ADD STATS HERE, and those sites east of Kodiak Island had lower richness.&nbsp; Alpha diversity (exp H') varied little between  study areas, and averaged approx. 9 species across both shallow and deep sites (Figure 2 c, d).&nbsp; Shallow site 9 again had slightly higher alpha diversity on average, but also had higher variability and ADD STATS HERE, while deep site 13, at the western end of Kodiak Island, had the lowest diversity ADD STATS HERE.&nbsp; Beta diversity was also remarkably similar across both shallow and deep areas, and averaged approx. 9 in shallow areas and 5 in deep areas (Figure 2 e, f).&nbsp; Overall, across these 31 years, taxonomic richness and diversity of the groundfish community varied little across the central GOA.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div>Ra<div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Mechanisms that underlie these effects are:<br></div><div>(spatial variation in) species' intrinsic responses to perturbations<br></div><div>a reduction in interspecific competition<br></div><div>functional redundancy??<br></div><div>dispersal (across space)<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Functional diversity<br></div><div>Rao's Q was similar among most shallow and deep study areas (Fig. 3f,g), with the exception of a few shallow areas:  a Tukey test indicated significant pairwise differences between shallow areas 6-1, 6-2, 6-4, and 9-2 (p &lt; 0.05).

 indicated spatial turnover in community composition in both shallow
 and deep study areas along a longitudinal gradient (Fig. 4). For both 
shallow and deep areas, PERMANOVA indicated that between-area 
differences were significant (Shallow: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222; Deep: p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>= 0.23) and a test of homogeneity of within-area dispersions affirmed 
that PERMANOVA results were attributable to real between-area 
differences in community composition (Shallow: p = 0.94, Deep: p = 
0.89). <br></div><div><i>For either results or discussion: For shallow areas, PERMANOVA indicated <i>that although both spatial and temporal processes had significant effects on community composition</i>,
 between-area variation was greater than temporal variation in community
 composition (F = 42.8 and 25.4, respectively). For deep areas, 
between-area variation had similar importance to temporal variation (F =
 27.3 and 24.4, respectively).</i><br></div><div>LIST THE 5 OR 10 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES.<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Portfolio Effect <br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tested the whether there was more variation among individual study areas vs. the region.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>CVs of the regional metacommunity (shallow sites 0.073; deep sites
