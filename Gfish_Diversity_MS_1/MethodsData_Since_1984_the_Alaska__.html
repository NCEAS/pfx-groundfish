<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Data<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish populations.&nbsp; The surveys were run
triennially from 1984 to 1999 and biannually thereafter (14 years total).&nbsp; The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts three commercial trawlers from May through August and samples the standard 320,000 km <sup>2</sup> survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species.  This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

The net is deployed from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at three knots.&nbsp; Once on the seafloor, the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).&nbsp; In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths, otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other species of interest.&nbsp; It should be noted that because species exhibit different vulnerability

	abstract = {For many taxa, diversity, often measured as species richness, decreases with latitude. In this report patterns of diversity (species richness, species diversity, and evenness) in groundfish assemblages were investigated in relation to depth (200–1200 m) and latitude (33–47°N) on the continental slope of the U.S. Pacific coast. The data originated from the 1999–2002 upper continental slope groundfish surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service. When the data were pooled across depths, species density and evenness were found to decline with latitude. All three diversity measures declined with depth, with the lowest overall diversity in the 600- to 900-m depth range where longspine thornyhead Sebastolobus altivelis constituted close to 70\% of the catch. When latitudinal gradients were examined within four depth zones (200–300 m, 400–500 m, 600–900 m, and 1000–1200 m) more complex patterns emerged. At depth species richness and evenness were inversely correlated with latitude as longspine thornyhead dominated catches to the north. However, in shallower areas of the slope, species richness and evenness were positively correlated with latitude. Latitudinal patterns of diversity in the deeper zones and when pooled across depths were positively correlated with temperature and broadly consistent with the Ambient Energy hypothesis discussed by Willig et al. [Annu Rev Ecol System 34:273–309 (2003)].},

	abstract = {For many taxa, diversity, often measured as species richness, decreases with latitude. In this report patterns of diversity (species richness, species diversity, and evenness) in groundfish assemblages were investigated in relation to depth (200–1200 m) and latitude (33–47°N) on the continental slope of the U.S. Pacific coast. The data originated from the 1999–2002 upper continental slope groundfish surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service. When the data were pooled across depths, species density and evenness were found to decline with latitude. All three diversity measures declined with depth, with the lowest overall diversity in the 600- to 900-m depth range where longspine thornyhead Sebastolobus altivelis constituted close to 70\% of the catch. When latitudinal gradients were examined within four depth zones (200–300 m, 400–500 m, 600–900 m, and 1000–1200 m) more complex patterns emerged. At depth species richness and evenness were inversely correlated with latitude as longspine thornyhead dominated catches to the north. However, in shallower areas of the slope, species richness and evenness were positively correlated with latitude. Latitudinal patterns of diversity in the deeper zones and when pooled across depths were positively correlated with temperature and broadly consistent with the Ambient Energy hypothesis discussed by Willig et al.

(‘occurrence model’) described the probability of occurrence of individual
species in each year and at each trawl location and the second sub-model
(‘positive model’) described the CPUE of species in each year and at each
location conditional on the occurrence of at least one individual. Both
sub-models model included spatial random effects that follow a first-order
autoregressive process and account for variation not explicitly included in the
model. Once the sub-models were estimated, model estimates were projected to
the center of 2 x 2 km grid cells created for the entire GOA. Shelton and coauthors generated
1,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samples from the joint approximate
posterior density for each species and for each MCMC sample predicted a density
for each sub-model to the 2 x 2km grid (Shelton et al.). Unconditional expectations for CPUE (kg hectare<sup>-1</sup>)
of species in each year and at each location were then calculated by
multiplying each MCMC sample from the occurrence and positive model. These
predicted CPUEs for each 2 x 2 km grid cell were combined to generate
index-standardized mean estimates (and standard deviations) of CPUE for each
species in each year within discrete study areas (see <i>Study Areas </i>below) (Shelton

145° W and 159° W, were separated by canyons or areas of shallower depth, and ranged in size from 1,352 – 15,136 km (see Supplementary Table S1 for more information on study areas).&nbsp; Though study areas were discrete, an artifact of the spatio-temporal statistical model is that some information is shared between study areas due to the spatial range of correlations.&nbsp; However, in most species/study area cases, the distances between the study areas exceeded the species range (see Supplementary Appendix A1).&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical Analysis

 quantifies the effective number of distinct communities and represents 
 differences in species composition among the shallow or deep study 
areas, and gamma diversity (<span data-equation="H\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\gamma\)</span>) is the effective number of distinct species across all shallow and deep areas.&nbsp; We began by correcting for uncertainty in the model predictions used to estimate species diversity metrics by resampling the 
expected distributions of species occurrence and densities within each study area 1000 times using 
bootstrap methods, and then calculating the mean and variance of the diversity metrics.&nbsp; We then estimated species richness by summing the predicted occurrence of all species within each each shallow and deep study

Question:

Is Rao's quadratic entropy a suitable measure of functional diversity if several traits are considered?


Methods:

It is checked whether Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) satisfies a priori criteria suggested by Mason et al. A real data set is used to show that there are often zeros in abundance distributions which maximize functional diversity.


Results and Conclusion:

FDQ fulfils all a priori criteria and it surpasses other proposed indices, because it includes species abundances and more than one trait. Therefore, it seems to be an improvement compared to measures of functional diversity that are currently available. An unexpected property of FDQ is that its value may decrease if species richness increases. The reason is that functional diversity is influenced by both species-abundance based diversity and differences among species. Introduction of a new species into the community increases the species-abundance based diversity, while it may decrease the average dissimilarity among species.},
