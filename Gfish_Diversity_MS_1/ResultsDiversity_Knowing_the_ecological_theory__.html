<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Diversity <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We explored the diversity-stability relationship in the groundfish community by examining five diversity metrics within each of the 9 shallow and 5 deep study areas in the GOA to understand how diversity varies across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; Species richness at each study area was relatively low (across the 31 years), and ranged from approximately 9 - 13 in shallow areas and 11 - 14 in deep areas, with the largest difference between any two sites being just 4 species (Figure 2 a, b).&nbsp; The western-most shallow sites (8, 9) had higher species richness ADD STATS HERE, and those sites east of Kodiak Island had lower richness.&nbsp; Alpha diversity (within area diversity exp<span data-equation="H" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\)</span>) varied little between  study areas, and averaged approximately 9 species across both shallow and deep sites (Figure 2 c, d).&nbsp; Shallow sites had slightly higher alpha diversity on average, but also had higher variability and ADD STATS HERE, while deep site 13, at the western end of Kodiak Island, had the lowest alpha diversity ADD STATS HERE.&nbsp; Beta diversity (between area diversity) was also remarkably similar across both shallow and deep areas, and averaged approximately 9 in shallow areas and 5 in deep areas (Figure 2 e, f).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the invariance of diversity both within and between study areas, we examined functional diversity to better understand this groundfish community.&nbsp; Rao's Q, our measure of functional diversity, showed little variation across most shallow and deep local communities with few exceptions (Figure 2 g, h): Shallow local community 6 differed significantly from local communities 1, 2, and 4, and local areas 2 and 9 also differed significantly  (Tukey test, p &lt; 0.05).&nbsp; Deep areas did not differ significantly in functional diversity (ANOVA, p = 0.071).&nbsp; Overall, species richness and diversity as well
 as functional diversity of the groundfish community was conserved across the central GOA over this 31-year period.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Community composition <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because functional diversity depends to a large extent on species identity, we examined also community composition. &nbsp;LIST THE 5 OR 10 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES ... were the most abundant species (XX% of total biomass).&nbsp;   Composition varied across a longitudinal gradient, with shallow sites 8 and 9 showing no overlap with the rest of the shallow sites (Figure 3 a).&nbsp; Despite areas 1 - 7 showing some overlap, all shallow sites were significantly different in composition from each other (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222).&nbsp; Likewise, the deep areas West of Kodiak Island also showed no overlap with those to the East, and though the distinction was less pronounced, all deep sites differed significantly in composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>= 0.23) (Figure 3 b).&nbsp; These results were confirmed by a homogeneity test of within-area dispersions, which indicates the differences area attributed to real between-area 
differences in community composition (shallow p = 0.94, deep p = 
0.89).&nbsp; Therefore, between both deep and shallow sites, the groundfish community composition varied across space with distinct groups of species in the individual study areas.&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
shallow study areas 1 - 7 east of Kodiak (and to a lesser degree in deep areas 1 - 4),
differences in community composition were driven by rare and intermediate-density species.&nbsp; Community
composition with respect to the most abundant species did not show spatial
turnover: compositional turnover was not apparent when data were transformed to
emphasize the influence of the most abundant species (i.e. Hellinger
transformation; Supplementary Figure S1); instead, turnover was only apparent
when data were transformed to allow subdominant species equal chance of
explaining community structure (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation; Figure
3).<br></div><div>

regional community CVs by a factor of 2.34 for shallow sites 
and a factor of 1.35 for deep sites.&nbsp; Mean CVs for shallow local  communities (0.171 +/- 0.043) were greater than that of the regional shallow community (0.073; Figure 4).&nbsp; Similarly, in deep study areas, local community CVs (0.253 +/- 0.077) were greater than the regional community CV (0.187; Figure 4).&nbsp; Therefore, the portfolio effect is evident because the regional GOA groundfish community (across approx. 2,000 km) is significantly less variable than local communities.&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><div>List of Figures &amp; Tables: <br></div><div>Figure 1:&nbsp; Map of shallow and deep study areas and EVOS spill <br></div><div>Figure 2: Diversity metrics;&nbsp; 8 panels - sp. richness, FD, alpha, beta - for shallow and deep areas <br></div><div>Figure 3: Community Composition; NMDS plots with hulls connecting years for a given study area<br></div><div>Figure 4:<b>&nbsp; </b>Spatial CV plots (spatial portfolio effect)<b> </b><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
