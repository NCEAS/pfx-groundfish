<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Diversity <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Knowing the ecological theory behind the diversity-stability relationship, we wanted to examine the mechanisms supporting this relationship in the groundfish community in the GOA.&nbsp; We began by examining a few diversity metrics within each of the 9 shallow and 5 deep study areas to understand how diversity varied across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; Species richness at each study area was relatively low (across the 31 years), and ranged from approx. 9 - 13 in shallow areas and 11 - 14 in deep areas with the largest difference between any two sites just 4 species (Figure 2 a, b).&nbsp; Western-most shallow sites (# 8, 9) had higher species richness ADD STATS HERE, and those sites east of Kodiak Island had lower richness.&nbsp; Alpha diversity (exp H') varied little between  study areas, and averaged approx. 9 species across both shallow and deep sites (Figure 2 c, d).&nbsp; Shallow site 9 again had slightly higher alpha diversity on average, but also had higher variability and ADD STATS HERE, while deep site 13, at the western end of Kodiak Island, had the lowest diversity ADD STATS HERE.&nbsp; Beta diversity (between-area diversity) was also remarkably similar across both shallow and deep areas, and averaged approx. 9 in shallow areas and 5 in deep areas (Figure 2 e, f).&nbsp;&nbsp; Given the invariance of diversity both within and between study areas, we examined functional diversity to better understand this community.&nbsp; Rao's Q, our measure of functional diversity, was also quite similar across most shallow and deep study areas except for a few (Figure 2 g, h).&nbsp; Shallow area 6 differed significantly from areas 1, 2, and 4, and area 2 was also significantly different from area 9 (Tukey test, p &lt; 0.05).&nbsp; Deep areas did not differ significantly in functional diversity (ANOVA, p = 0.071).&nbsp; Overall, across these 31 years, taxonomic richness and diversity as well
 as functional diversity of the groundfish community varied little 
across the central GOA.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Community composition <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because functional diversity depends to a large extent on species identity, we examined also community composition. &nbsp;LIST THE 5 OR 10 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES.&nbsp;   Composition varied across a longitudinal gradient, with shallow sites 8 and 9 showing no overlap with the rest of the shallow sites (Figure 3 a).&nbsp; Despite sites 1 - 7 showing some overlap, all shallow sites were significantly different in composition from each other (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222).&nbsp; Likewise, the deep sites West of Kodiak Island also showed no overlap with those to the East, and though the distinction was less pronounced, all deep sites differed significantly in composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span data-equation="^2" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span data-equation="^{ }" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>= 0.23) (Figure 3 b).&nbsp; These results were confirmed by a homogeneity test of within-area dispersions (eh????&nbsp; Is there a less jarony way to say this???) that indicated differences were attributable to real between-area 
differences in community composition (Shallow p = 0.94, Deep p = 
0.89).&nbsp; Overall...<br></div><br><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Portfolio Effect <br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While our diversity metrics point at a stabilizing effect across the GOA, we also explicity tested the whether there was more variation among individual study areas as compared to the regional metacommunity (the portfolio effect).&nbsp; Mean local study area coefficients of variation (CVs) were greater than 
regional metacommunity CVs by a factor of 2.34 for shallow sites 
and a factor of 1.35 for deep sites.&nbsp; Mean CVs for individual shallow study areas were higher than for the regional shallow metacommunity (0.171 +/- 0.043, and 0.073 respectively).&nbsp; This was also true in deep study areas where the CVs of individual areas averaged 0.253 (+/- 0.077), while the regional metacommunity CV was 0.187.&nbsp; Overall..<br></div><div> <br></div><br></div><div><br></div><div>List of Figures &amp; Tables: <br></div><div>Figure 1:&nbsp; Map of shallow and deep study areas and EVOS spill <br></div><div>Figure 2: Diversity metrics;&nbsp; 8 panels - sp. richness, FD, alpha, beta - for shallow and deep areas <br></div><div>Figure 3: Community Composition; NMDS plots with hulls connecting years for a given study area<br></div><div>Figure 4:<b>&nbsp; </b>Spatial CV plots<b> </b><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Mechanisms that underlie these effects are:<br></div><div>(spatial variation in) species' intrinsic responses to perturbations<br></div><div>a reduction in interspecific competition<br></div><div>functional redundancy??<br></div><div>dispersal (across space)<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
