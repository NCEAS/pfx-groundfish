<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Results<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Diversity <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We explored patterns of diversity in the groundfish community by examining five diversity metrics within each of the 9 shallow and 5 deep study areas in the GOA to understand how diversity varies across this large marine ecosystem.&nbsp; Species richness at each study area was relatively low (across the 31 years), and ranged from approximately 9 - 13, with the largest difference between any two sites being just 4 species (Figure 2b).&nbsp; The western-most sites (9, 10) had higher species richness ADD STATS HERE, and those sites east of Kodiak Island had lower richness (Figures 1 &amp; 2).&nbsp; Alpha diversity (within area diversity exp<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="H" contenteditable="false">\(H\)</span>) varied little between  study areas, and averaged approximately 9 species across  sites (Figure 2a).&nbsp;  Beta diversity (between area diversity <span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span>) was also remarkably similar across both shallow and deep areas, and averaged approximately 9 in shallow areas and 5 in deep areas (Figure 2 e, f).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the invariance of diversity both within and between study areas, we examined functional diversity to better understand this groundfish community.&nbsp; Rao's Q, our measure of functional diversity, showed little variation across local communities with few exceptions (Figure 2d):  local study area 6 differed significantly from local areas 1, 2, and 4, and local areas 2 and 10 also differed significantly  (Tukey test, p &lt; 0.05).&nbsp; Overall, species richness and diversity as well
 as functional diversity of the groundfish community was conserved across the central GOA over this 31-year period.&nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Community composition <br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because functional diversity depends to a large extent on species identity, we examined also community composition. &nbsp;LIST THE 5 OR 10 MOST ABUNDANT SPECIES ... were the most abundant species (XX% of total biomass).&nbsp;   Composition varied across a longitudinal gradient, with shallow sites 8-10 showing no overlap with the rest of the shallow sites (Figure 3 a).&nbsp; Despite areas 2 - 7 showing some overlap, all shallow sites were significantly different in composition from each other (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="^2" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="^{ }" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span> = 0.222).&nbsp; Likewise, the deep areas West of Kodiak Island also showed no overlap with those to the East, and though the distinction was less pronounced, all deep sites differed significantly in composition (PERMANOVA, p = 0.005, R<span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="^2" contenteditable="false">\(^2\)</span><span class="ltx_Math" data-equation="^{ }" contenteditable="false">\(^{ }\)</span>= 0.16) (Figure 3 b).&nbsp; These results were confirmed by a homogeneity test of within-area dispersions, which indicates the differences area attributed to real between-area 
differences in community composition (shallow p = 0.94, deep p = 
0.89).&nbsp; Therefore, between both deep and shallow sites, the groundfish community composition varied across space with distinct groups of species in the individual study areas.&nbsp; <br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
shallow study areas 1 - 7 east of Kodiak (and to a lesser degree in deep areas 11, 12, 14, and 15),
differences in community composition were driven by rare and intermediate-density species.&nbsp; Composition of the most abundant species did not show changes: transforming the data to
emphasize the influence of the most abundant species did not change which species were most abundant (i.e. Hellinger
transformation, Supplementary Figure S1).&nbsp; Instead, changes in community composition were only apparent
when data were transformed to allow subdominant species equal chance of
explaining community structure (i.e. Wisconsin - Square root transformation, Figure
3).<br></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div>List of Figures &amp; Tables: <br></div><br></div><div><div>Figure 1:&nbsp; Map of study areas <br></div><div>Figure 2: Diversity metrics;&nbsp; 4 panels - sp. richness, FD, alpha, beta <br></div><div>Figure 3: Community Composition; NMDS plot (Wisconsin) with hulls connecting years for a given study area<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><br></div><div><br></div>
