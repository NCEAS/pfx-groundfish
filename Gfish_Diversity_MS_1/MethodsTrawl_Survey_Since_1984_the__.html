<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Trawl Survey<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts 3 commercial trawlers during May–August and samples the standard 320,000 km2 survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species.&nbsp; This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

Estimates of trophic position are from Aydin et al. 2007. Where possible we used trait data (means) from the Gulf of Alaska; when these were not available we used means of all available data from other regions. We used the following four functional traits: maximum length, maximum age, maximum depth at which the species is commonly found, and the depth of each species peak CPUE (Ole's depthCoefPos ... need to write more about how this was calculated) <i>NB I left out trophic position because it was strongly correlated with max length, and I left out diet info because this was the categorical variable that gave a weird answer (extremely low Rao's Q values), although qualitatively similar to values calculated using only continuous variables</i>. We found data for 45(?check this) species (<i>note to self: make sure this subset isn't biased towards any particular functional groups</i>). Continuous traits were log-transformed prior to analysis (Botta-Dukat 2005). Traits were uncorrelated.
