<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts 3 commercial trawlers from May through August and samples the standard 320,000 km <sup>2</sup> survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species.  This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

The net is deployed from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at 3 knots.&nbsp; Once on the seafloor, the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).&nbsp; In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths, otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other species of interest.&nbsp; It should be noted that because species exhibit different vulnerability

Size increased with depth during both seasons for G. morhua and for M. aeglefinus during the fall, but decreased with depth for M. aeglefinus during the spring. Haddock size class distributions in the spring were also related to bottom temperature, with smaller individuals generally occurring in the warmest waters. For S. acanthias, depth was also the primary environmental variable explaining size class distributions in the fall, although size decreased with depth for this species. In the spring, bottom temperature was more important for spiny dogfish with smaller individuals associated with warmer bottom waters. Similarly, bottom temperature had the most explanatory value for M. bilinearis during both seasons, with size increasing with temperature. Seasonal associations with depth and temperature are related to spawning migrations, thermal preferences and other ecological factors. Time-block accounted for a notable amount of variance, particularly for S. acanthias and M. bilinearis, and was reflective of how population size structure has responded to exploitation over the time series.

possible we used trait data from the Gulf of Alaska, however, when these

 available we used  all available data from other regions.&nbsp; This subset

particular functional groups or traits.&nbsp; <br></div><br><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mapped the extent of both the trawl survey data and  the EVOS over 
the shelf region of the central GOA.&nbsp; We then selected study areas on 
the shelf across a gradient of expected oil exposure and based on bottom
 depth: 9 contiguous areas of depth 50 - 150 m ('shallow areas'), 5 
additional contiguous areas of 151 - 300 m ('deep areas') (Figure 1).&nbsp; This provided us with an area  East of the spill that likely did 
not receive oil (shallow area 1), areas that were likely oiled (shallow 
areas 2 - 6, deep areas 1 - 2), and areas West of the spill extent that 
were also likely unoiled (shallow areas 7 - 9, deep areas 3 - 5) (Figure
 1).&nbsp; Study areas ranged in size from 1,352 – 15,136 km, were located between 
145° W and 159° W, and had average bottom temperatures between ???? for shallow and 
???? for deep areas (Supplementary Table S1).&nbsp;<br></div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Statistical Analysis

calculated several diversity metrics: species richness, alpha, beta, and gamma  diversity, and functional diversity.&nbsp; We corrected for uncertainty in abundance data by resampling the

bootstrap methods, and calculated mean abundance and confidence intervals.&nbsp; We then estimated species richness&nbsp;for each shallow and deep study

Question:

Is Rao's quadratic entropy a suitable measure of functional diversity if several traits are considered?


Methods:

It is checked whether Rao's quadratic entropy (FDQ) satisfies a priori criteria suggested by Mason et al. A real data set is used to show that there are often zeros in abundance distributions which maximize functional diversity.


Results and Conclusion:

FDQ fulfils all a priori criteria and it surpasses other proposed indices, because it includes species abundances and more than one trait. Therefore, it seems to be an improvement compared to measures of functional diversity that are currently available. An unexpected property of FDQ is that its value may decrease if species richness increases. The reason is that functional diversity is influenced by both species-abundance based diversity and differences among species. Introduction of a new species into the community increases the species-abundance based diversity, while it may decrease the average dissimilarity among species.},
