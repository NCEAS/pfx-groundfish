The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts 3 commercial trawlers during May–August and samples the standard 320,000 km <sup>2</sup> survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species.&nbsp; This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (<cite class="ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

Diet information was compiled from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Monitoring diet database (<a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php">afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php</a>). Estimates of trophic position are from Aydin et al. 2007. Where possible we used trait data from the Gulf of Alaska; when these were not available we used  all available data from other regions. <i>(NB traits are: max length, max age, max depth at which the species is commonly found, depth of each species peak CPUE (Ole's depthCoefPos ... need to write more about how this was calculated in this appendix), adult water column position, diet, and feeding guild ... this info will be in the appendix, not here)</i>.&nbsp;We found complete sets of trait data for 44 species; this subset of the species pool was not biased towards any particular functional groups or traits. We evaluated functional diversity using Rao's index of quadratic entropy (henceforth Rao's Q; Rao 1982), which represents functional richness and functional divergence (Mouchet et al. 2010), using a square-root corrected species-by-species Gower distance matrix for functional traits. Continuous traits were log-transformed prior to analysis (Botta-Dukat 2005) and we used only uncorrelated traits. We used mean abundance (CPUE) estimates from the geospatial model for the species-by-species abundance matrix. <i>We did not correct Rao's Q values for the effect of species richness  
(cite? could use Mouchet et al. 2008?) because species richness was not 
significantly different between areas (Fig. X).&nbsp;</i> To test for between-area differences in Rao's Q, we used a 1-way ANOVA + Tukey test.<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Data and Code Availability<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trawl data, geostatistical model code and output, and code used to
