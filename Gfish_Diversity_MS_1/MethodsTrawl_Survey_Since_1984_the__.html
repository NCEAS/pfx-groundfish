<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Trawl Survey<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts 3 commercial trawlers from May through August and samples the standard 320,000 km <sup>2</sup> survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species. .  This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (CITE von_szalay_2010).

<h1 class="><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The net used in this survey is a four-seam, high-opening Poly Nor’Eastern trawl featuring a 27.2 m headrope and a 36.7 m footrope equipped with rubber bobbin roller gear. The net is deployed from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at 3 knots.&nbsp; Once on the seafloor, the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).&nbsp; In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths, otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other species of interest.<br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Study Areas<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We mapped the extent of both the trawl survey data and  the EVOS over the shelf region of the central GOA.&nbsp; We then selected study areas on the shelf across a gradient of expected oil exposure and based on bottom depth: 9 contiguous areas of depth 50 - 150 m ('shallow areas'), 5 additional contiguous areas of 151 - 300 m ('deep areas') (Figure 1).&nbsp; Study areas ranged in size from 1,352 – 15,136 km, were located between 145° W and 159° W, and had average bottom temperatures between ???? and ????.&nbsp; This provided us with an area  East of the spill that likely did not receive oil (shallow area 1), areas that were likely oiled (shallow areas 2 - 6, deep areas 1 - 2), and areas West of the spill extent that were also likely unoiled (shallow areas 7 - 9, deep areas 3 - 5) (Figure 1, Supplementary Table S1).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Modeling<br></h2><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AFSC survey data were smoothed using a geostatistical model developed by 
by (CITE ono_space-time_2016, shelton_spatial_2014).  Briefly, ...  The model treated year and depth as fixed effects on CPUE. Most groundfish exhibit spatial partitions related to depth (CITATION NEEDED). In addition many groundfish also exhibit notable ontogenetic shifts in depth (CITATION). Including depth as a fixed effect corrects for species specific affinities for a given depth range. To correct for ontogenetic shifts in depth, the depth and temperature distributions were examined by length category for species that had continuous time series of length measurements. Models details are provided in Appendix X in supplementary materials. 
The estimated range at which the spatial correlation in the spatial field falls to 0.05 after accounting for depth ranged from 10km – 500km with most species exhibiting a range of 65km.&nbsp; Species with higher frequencies of occurrence tended to have lower spatial ranges with the dominant species (cod, halibut, sablefish, and pollock) being less than 60km.&nbsp; Area expansions derived from the model were used to estimate occurrence and abundance for each of the 9 shallow areas and 5 deep areas.&nbsp; Some information is shared between regions due to the the spatial range of correlations, however in most species/region cases the distances between the 9 regions exceeded the species range.&nbsp; For each of the shallow and deep areas, the mean and variance of occurrence biomass by species was calculated.&nbsp; It should be noted that the species exhibit different vulnerability to the survey trawl.&nbsp; Thus, all results reflect the demersal shelf fish community. 
Statistical Analysis
To evaluate spatial diversity, we assessed spatial variation in community composition across local study areas using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) with Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. We used mean abundance (CPUE) estimates from the geospatial model for this analysis. CPUEs of individual species varied by eight orders of magnitude between study areas and years; therefore, to allow the result to be driven equally by rare and abundant species, data were standardized using a wisconsin-style double transformation of square-root transformed data. To evaluate whether spatial turnover was driven by dominant or subdominant species, we simultaneously ran nMDS using a Hellinger transformation, which yields a result driven by only the most dominant species). We used PERMANOVA (Anderson 2001) to evaluate the significance of between-area differences in community composition. To evaluate whether PERMANOVA results were driven by between- or within-area differences in (temporal) replicates, and we evaluated the homogeneity of within-ecoregion dispersions (Anderson 2006).  Multivariate analyses were computed using the vegan package (cite? Oksanen et al. 2016) in R.

Spatial stability in Alpha and Beta Diversity
To assess spatial stability in various components of local diversity, we evaluated between-local area variation in species richness, alpha and beta (local saturation) diversity, and functional diversity / redundancy. Species richness was estimated by summing the mean probability of occurrence of all species at each shallow and deep study area, <span data-equation="\Sigma pi^0" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(\Sigma pi^0\)</span>. Alpha and beta  components of diversity were estimated based on (CITE Jost 2007). 
The
alpha component (<span data-equation="H\alpha" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\alpha\)</span>) quantifies the effective number of species and reflects diversity at each shallow and deep area. The beta component (<span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span>) quantifies the effective number of distinct communities and represents the differences in species composition among the shallow or deep areas. Components of species diversity were derived from estimated mean biomass for each species
within a region and calculated as follows:<br></div><div><br></div><div><span data-equation="H\alpha jy=exp\left(-\Sigma pijylnpijy\right)" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\alpha jy=exp\left(-\Sigma pijylnpijy\right)\)</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>where <i>pijy </i>is the proportional abundance of species <i>i</i> at area <i>j</i> and ln is the natural logarithm, <br></div><div><br></div><div><i><span data-equation="H\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\gamma\)</span> = </i><br></div><div><br></div><div>where&nbsp;<span data-equation="\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(\gamma\)</span>  represents the total diversity of all shallow areas <i>j </i>or deep areas <i>j</i> combined, and <br></div><div><br></div><div><span data-equation="H\beta=\frac{\gamma}{a}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta=\frac{\gamma}{a}\)</span><br></div><div><br></div><div>To correct for uncertainty in regional abundance, we resampled the expected distribution of all species within each area 1000 times using bootstrap methods. The diversity analysis was then conducted on the bootstrapped subsamples to extract the median (or mean) and confidence intervals for species richness, <span data-equation="Ha" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Ha\)</span>,  <i><span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span> </i>and <span data-equation="H\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\gamma\)</span> at each area.

Diversity metrics were calculated using the ‘vegan’ package (version 2.3-5) in R (version 3.3.0). R code for the bootstrapping analysis is provided in supplementary  materials.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div><i>
Functional Diversity</i><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To evaluate the degree of functional redundancy between study areas, we assessed functional diversity. Functional trait data (Appendix X) were compiled from fishbase.org (accessed Feb 22-26 2016), the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's life history database (<a href="http://access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/LHWeb">access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/LHWeb</a>; accessed Feb 22-26 2016), and 2015 Stock Assessment reports (cite). Diet information was compiled from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Monitoring diet database (<a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php">afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php</a>). Estimates of trophic position are from Aydin et al. 2007. Where possible we used trait data from the Gulf of Alaska; when these were not available we used  all available data from other regions. <i>(NB traits are: max length, max age, max depth at which the species is commonly found, depth of each species peak CPUE (Ole's depthCoefPos ... need to write more about how this was calculated in this appendix), adult water column position, diet, and feeding guild ... this info will be in the appendix, not here)</i>.&nbsp;We found complete sets of trait data for 44 species; this subset of the species pool was not biased towards any particular functional groups or traits. We evaluated functional diversity using Rao's index of quadratic entropy (henceforth Rao's Q; Rao 1982), which represents functional richness and functional divergence (Mouchet et al. 2010), using a square-root corrected species-by-species Gower distance matrix for functional traits. Continuous traits were log-transformed prior to analysis (Botta-Dukat 2005) and we used only uncorrelated traits. We used mean abundance (CPUE) estimates from the geospatial model for the species-by-species abundance matrix. <i>We did not correct Rao's Q values for the effect of species richness  (cite? could use Mouchet et al. 2008?) because species richness was not significantly different between areas (Fig. X).&nbsp;</i> To test for between-area differences in Rao's Q, we used a 1-way ANOVA + Tukey test.<br></div><div><br></div><br></div><br></div><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">
