<h1 class="ltx_title_section">Methods<br></h1><h2 class="ltx_title_subsection">Trawl Survey<br></h2><div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC contracts 3 commercial trawlers from May through August and samples the standard 320,000 km <sup>2</sup> survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important groundfish species.  This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (<cite class="squire-citation ltx_cite" data-bib-text="

The net is deployed from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at 3 knots.&nbsp; Once on the seafloor, the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).&nbsp; In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths, otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other species of interest.&nbsp; It should be noted that because species exhibit different vulnerability

In the spring, bottom temperature was more important for spiny dogfish with smaller individuals associated with warmer bottom waters.

<br></h2><div><div>Alpha, Beta, Gamma<br></div><div>To assess spatial stability in various components of local diversity, we
 evaluated between-local area variation in species richness, alpha and 
beta (local saturation) diversity, and functional diversity / 
redundancy. Species richness was estimated by summing the mean 
probability of occurrence of all species at each shallow and deep study 
area, <span data-equation="\Sigma pi^0" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(\Sigma pi^0\)</span>. Alpha and beta  components of diversity were estimated based on (CITE Jost 2007). 
The
alpha component (<span data-equation="H\alpha" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\alpha\)</span>) quantifies the effective number of species and reflects diversity at each shallow and deep area. The beta component (<span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span>)
 quantifies the effective number of distinct communities and represents 
the differences in species composition among the shallow or deep areas. 
Components of species diversity were derived from estimated mean biomass
 for each species
within a region and calculated as follows: x<span data-equation="H\alpha jy=exp\left(-\Sigma pijylnpijy\right)" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\alpha jy=exp\left(-\Sigma pijylnpijy\right)\)</span> where <i>pijy </i>is the proportional abundance of species <i>i</i> at area <i>j</i> and ln is the natural logarithm,&nbsp; <i><span data-equation="H\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\gamma\)</span> = </i>where&nbsp;<span data-equation="\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(\gamma\)</span>  represents the total diversity of all shallow areas <i>j </i>or deep areas <i>j</i> combined, and <span data-equation="H\beta=\frac{\gamma}{a}" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta=\frac{\gamma}{a}\)</span>&nbsp;
 To correct for uncertainty in regional abundance, we resampled the 
expected distribution of all species within each area 1000 times using 
bootstrap methods. The diversity analysis was then conducted on the 
bootstrapped subsamples to extract the median (or mean) and confidence 
intervals for species richness, <span data-equation="Ha" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(Ha\)</span>,  <i><span data-equation="H\beta" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\beta\)</span> </i>and <span data-equation="H\gamma" class="ltx_Math" contenteditable="false">\(H\gamma\)</span>
 at each area.

Diversity metrics were calculated using the ‘vegan’ package (version 
2.3-5) in R (version 3.3.0). R code for the bootstrapping analysis is 
provided in supplementary  materials.<br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>FD<br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To evaluate the degree of functional redundancy between study 
areas, we assessed functional diversity. Functional trait data (Appendix
 X) were compiled from fishbase.org (accessed Feb 22-26 2016), the 
Alaska Fisheries Science Center's life history database (<a href="http://access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/LHWeb">access.afsc.noaa.gov/reem/LHWeb</a>;
 accessed Feb 22-26 2016), and 2015 Stock Assessment reports (cite). 
Diet information was compiled from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center's
 Resource Ecology and Ecosystem Monitoring diet database (<a href="http://www.afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php">afsc.noaa.gov/REFM/REEM/Default.php</a>).
 Estimates of trophic position are from Aydin et al. 2007. Where 
possible we used trait data from the Gulf of Alaska; when these were not
 available we used  all available data from other regions. <i>(NB traits
 are: max length, max age, max depth at which the species is commonly 
found, depth of each species peak CPUE (Ole's depthCoefPos ... need to 
write more about how this was calculated in this appendix), adult water 
column position, diet, and feeding guild ... this info will be in the 
appendix, not here)</i>.&nbsp;We found complete sets of trait data for 44 
species; this subset of the species pool was not biased towards any 
particular functional groups or traits. We evaluated functional 
diversity using Rao's index of quadratic entropy (henceforth Rao's Q; 
Rao 1982), which represents functional richness and functional 
divergence (Mouchet et al. 2010), using a square-root corrected 
species-by-species Gower distance matrix for functional traits. 
Continuous traits were log-transformed prior to analysis (Botta-Dukat 
2005) and we used only uncorrelated traits. We used mean abundance 
(CPUE) estimates from the geospatial model for the species-by-species 
abundance matrix. <i>We did not correct Rao's Q values for the effect of
 species richness  (cite? could use Mouchet et al. 2008?) because 
species richness was not significantly different between areas (Fig. 
X).&nbsp;</i> To test for between-area differences in Rao's Q, we used a 1-way ANOVA + Tukey test.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Community Comp.<br></div><div>We assessed spatial variation in community composition across local study areas using non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) with Bray-Curtis dissimilarities. We used mean abundance (CPUE) estimates from the geospatial model for this analysis. CPUEs of individual species varied by eight orders of magnitude between study areas and years; therefore, to allow the result to be driven equally by rare and abundant species, data were standardized using a wisconsin-style double transformation of square-root transformed data. To evaluate whether spatial turnover was driven by dominant or subdominant species, we simultaneously ran nMDS using a Hellinger transformation, which yields a result driven by only the most dominant species). We used PERMANOVA (Anderson 2001) to evaluate the significance of between-area differences in community composition. To evaluate whether PERMANOVA results were driven by between- or within-area differences in (temporal) replicates, and we evaluated the homogeneity of within-ecoregion dispersions (Anderson 2006).  Multivariate analyses were computed using the vegan package (cite? Oksanen et al. 2016) in R.
