<div>Alpha (within study area) and
beta (between study areas) components of diversity were estimated based on
(Jost 2007). [ADD EQUATIONS] Components of species diversity were derived from estimated mean
biomass for each species within a region. To correct for uncertainty in
regional abundance we re-sampled the expected distribution of species within
each region 1000 times using bootstrap methods (see link for R code).<br></div>
