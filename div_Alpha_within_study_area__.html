<div>Alpha (within study area) and
beta (between study areas) components of diversity were estimated based on
(Jost 2007). Components of species diversity were derived from estimated mean
biomass for each species within a region. To correct for uncertainty in
regional abundance we resampled the expected distribution of species within
each region 1000 times using bootstrap methods.<br></div>
