  abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity–stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity–stability debate to a final resolution.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: A shift in ocean climate during the late 1970s triggered a reorganization of community structure in the Gulf of Alaska ecosystem, as evidenced in changing catch composition on long-term (1953 to 1997) small-mesh trawl surveys. Forage species such as pandalid shrimp and capelin declined because of recruitment failure and predation, and populations have not yet recovered. Total trawl catch biomass declined {\textgreater}50\% and remained low through the 1980s. In contrast, recruitment of high trophic-level groundfish improved during the 1980s, yielding a {\textgreater}250\% increase in catch biomass during the 1990s. This trophic reorganization apparently had negative effects on piscivorous sea birds and marine mammals.},

  abstract = {A review of oceanographic and climate data from the North Pacific and Bering Sea has revealed climate events that occur on two principal time scales: a) 2–7 years (i.e. El Niño Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and b) inter-decadal (i.e. Pacific Decadal Oscillation, PDO). The timing of ENSO events and of related oceanic changes at higher latitudes were examined. The frequency of ENSO was high in the 1980s. Evidence of ENSO forcing on ocean conditions in the North Pacific (Niño North conditions) showed ENSO events were more frequently observed along the West Coast than in the western Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and Eastern Bering Sea (EBS). Time series of catches for 30 region/species groups of salmon, and recruitment data for 29 groundfish and 5 non-salmonid pelagic species, were examined for evidence of a statistical relationship with any of the time scales associated with Niño North conditions or the PDO. Some flatfish stocks exhibited high autocorrelation in recruitment coupled with a significant step in recruitment in 1977 suggesting a relationship between PDO forcing and recruitment success. Five of the dominant gadid stocks (EBS and GOA Pacific cod, Pacific hake and EBS and GOA walleye pollock) exhibited low autocorrelation in recruitment. Of these, Pacific hake, GOA walleye pollock and GOA Pacific cod exhibited significantly higher incidence of strong year classes in years associated with Niño North conditions. These findings suggest that the PDO and ENSO may play an important role in governing year-class strength of several Northeast Pacific marine fish stocks.},

  abstract = {Acoustic trawl surveys were conducted in 2000 and 2001 in two troughs located off the eastern coast of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska as part of a multiyear, multidisciplinary experiment to examine the influence of environmental conditions on the spatial distribution of adult and juvenile walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and capelin (Mallotus villosus). Continuous underway sea surface temperature samples and water column profiles collected in 2000 and 2001 showed the presence of a sharp shelf-break front in Chiniak Trough and a mid-trough front in Barnabas Trough. At distances {\textless}22 km from shore, the water column was well mixed, whereas a well-defined mixed layer was present beyond approximately 22 km from shore. Satellite drifter tracks in Barnabas Trough entered along the upstream edge of the trough and appeared to follow the frontal boundary across the middle portion of the trough. A storm in 2001 weakened stratification and cooled surface water temperature by 1.6–2.1°C. Wind mixing associated with the storm event mixed subsurface chlorophyll a to the surface and enhanced nutrients in the surface waters. The storm event revealed spatial partitioning of summer production in Barnabas Trough, with production concentrated in regions inside the mid-trough front. In contrast, post-storm summer production was distributed throughout Chiniak Trough. The spatial distribution of walleye pollock and capelin differed and appeared to be related to differences in habitat characteristics. Acoustic survey data identified four acoustic sign types: age-1 pollock, adult pollock, capelin, capelin–age-0 pollock mix. The spatial distribution of these four sign types appears to be influenced by the oceanographic and topographic features of the two troughs. Adult pollock were broadly distributed throughout Chiniak Trough, whereas adult pollock were aggregated on the coastal side of the frontal system in Barnabas Trough. In 2000, capelin occurred with age-0 pollock. In Chiniak Trough, capelin were most abundant along steep topographic gradients at the edges of the trough and in a deep region near Cape Chiniak, whereas the capelin–age-0 mix (2000) or capelin (2001) concentrations were observed in slope water intrusions over the outer shelf in Barnabas Trough. Results suggest that habitat selection of walleye pollock and capelin are controlled by different processes. Capelin distributions appear to be limited by oceanographic conditions while other factors appear to be more important for pollock.},
