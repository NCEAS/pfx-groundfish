<div>Since 1984, the Alaska Fisheries
Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the
GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish
populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper
continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of
Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC
contracts 3 commercial trawlers during May–August and samples the standard
320,000 km2 survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data
result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and
expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important
groundfish species. This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random
design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (von Szalay et al.
2010 ).<br></div>
