Science Center (AFSC) has conducted comprehensive bottom trawl surveys in the
GOA to monitor trends in the distribution and abundance of groundfish
populations. The full survey area includes the continental shelf and upper
continental slope (to 1,000 m depth) in the GOA and extends from the Islands of
Four Mountains (170° W) 2,300 km east to Dixon Entrance (54° N). The AFSC
contracts 3 commercial trawlers during May–August and samples the standard
320,000 km2 survey area with approximately 820 survey stations. The catch data
result in observations of catch-per-unit-area (CPUE) which are averaged and
expanded by survey area to estimate the relative abundance of important
groundfish species. This multi-species survey is based upon a stratified-random
design and the area-swept method of estimating abundance (von Szalay et al.
2010 ).<br></div><div>The net used in this survey is a
four-seam, high-opening Poly Nor’Eastern trawl featuring a 27.2 m headrope and
a 36.7 m footrope equipped with rubber bobbin roller gear. The net is deployed
from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at 3 knots. Once on the seafloor,
the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).
In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the
footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was
processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed
and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths,
otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other
species of interest.<br></div><h3>Study Areas<br></h3><div>We mapped the areas covered by
the trawl survey data as well as the extent of the EVOS over the shelf region
of the central GOA. We then selected study areas on the shelf across a gradient
of oil exposure and based on bottom depth: 9 contiguous areas of depth 50 - 150
m, 5 contiguous areas of 151 - 300 m (Figure 1). Study areas ranged in size
from xxx – yyy km2, and were located from XXXX degrees W to XXXXX degrees W.
This provided us with study areas that were East of the spill and did not
receive oil, at the same longitude as the spill and likely were oiled, and
areas West of the spill extent that were also likely unoiled.<br></div><h3>Modeling<br></h3><div>AFSC survey data were smoothed
using a geostatistical model developed by (Ono et al. 2015; Shelton et al.
2014). The model treated year and depth as fixed effects on CPUE. Most
groundfish exhibit spatial partitions related to depth (CITATION NEEDED). In
addition many groundfish also exhibit notable ontogenetic shifts in depth (CITATION).
Including depth as a fixed effect corrects for species specific affinities for
a given depth range. To correct for ontogenetic shifts in depth, the depth and
temperature distributions were examined by length category for species that had
continuous time series of length measurements.<br></div><div>The estimated range at which the
spatial correlation in the spatial field falls to 0.05 after accounting for
depth ranged from 10km – 500km with most species exhibiting a range of 65km.
Species with higher frequencies of occurrence tended to have lower spatial
ranges with the dominant species (cod, halibut, sablefish, and pollock) being
less than 60km. Area expansions derived from the model were used to estimate
abundance for each of the 9 sub-regions. Some information is shared between
regions due to the the spatial range of correlations, however in most
species/region cases the distances between the 9 regions exceeded the species
range. For each of the nine regions the mean and variance of biomass by species
was calculated. It should be noted that the species exhibit different
vulnerability to the survey trawl. Thus, all results reflect the demersal shelf
fish community.<br></div><h3>Statistical Analysis<br></h3><div>Stability = temporal stability in
this case. Stability over the 32 years of the study.<br></div><div>Alpha (within study area) and
beta (between study areas) components of diversity were estimated based on
(Jost 2007). Components of species diversity were derived from estimated mean
biomass for each species within a region. To correct for uncertainty in
regional abundance we resampled the expected distribution of species within
each region 1000 times using bootstrap methods.<br></div><div>To evaluate regional differences
in ecosystem structure we partitioned the predicted mean biomass for a given
species into functional groups using based on the NMFS food-habits database
(xxxx). For each ecoregion the mean density for each region was plotted and the
biomass in each trophic guild was estimated (Table 2, Figure 2) for the entire
time series 1984 – present.<br></div>
