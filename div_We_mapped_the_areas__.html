<div>We mapped the areas covered by
the trawl survey data as well as the extent of the EVOS over the shelf region
of the central GOA. We then selected study areas on the shelf across a gradient
of oil exposure and based on bottom depth: 9 contiguous areas of depth 50 - 150
m, 5 contiguous areas of 151 - 300 m (Figure 1). Study areas ranged in size
from xxx â€“ yyy km2, and were located from XXXX degrees W to XXXXX degrees W.
This provided us with study areas that were East of the spill and did not
receive oil, at the same longitude as the spill and likely were oiled, and
areas West of the spill extent that were also likely unoiled.<br></div>
