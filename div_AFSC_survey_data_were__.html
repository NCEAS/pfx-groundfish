<div>AFSC survey data were smoothed
using a geostatistical model (Shelton et al.
2014; Ono et al. 2015). The model treated year and depth as fixed effects on CPUE. Most
groundfish exhibit spatial partitions related to depth (CITATION NEEDED). In
addition many groundfish also exhibit notable ontogenetic shifts in depth (CITATION).
Including depth as a fixed effect corrects for species specific affinities for
a given depth range. To correct for ontogenetic shifts in depth, the depth and
temperature distributions were examined by length category for species that had
continuous time series of length measurements.<br></div>
