<div>To evaluate regional differences
in ecosystem structure we partitioned the predicted mean biomass for a given
species into functional groups using information from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) food-habits database
(xxxx). For each ecoregion the mean density for each region was plotted and the
biomass in each trophic guild was estimated (Table 2, Figure 2) for the entire
time series 1984 â€“ present.<br></div>
