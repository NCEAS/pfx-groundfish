<div>The net used in this survey is a
four-seam, high-opening Poly Norâ€™Eastern trawl featuring a 27.2 m headrope and
a 36.7 m footrope equipped with rubber bobbin roller gear. The net is deployed
from the vessel while the vessel steams ahead at 3 knots. Once on the seafloor,
the net is towed for 30 minutes (prior to 1992) or 15 minutes (1992 - present).
In most years the net was equipped with a bottom contact sensor on the
footrope, and a Seabird SBE-39 bathythermograph on the headrope. The catch was
processed by the scientific crew who identified all living organisms, weighed
and counted the catch of each species, and took biological samples (lengths,
otoliths, and specially requested tissues) from key groundfish species or other
species of interest.<br></div>
